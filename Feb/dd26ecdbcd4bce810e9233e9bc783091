One of the Tatham Art Gallery’s most popular exhibits, the Gilded Ormolu Clock, is finally back home in the ceramics gallery. Hayfields-based horologist (clockmaker) Mark Webber has spent months taking the clock apart, repairing damaged springs and some of the decorative pieces, including to the centrepiece: an old English street scene. The clock, which is believed to date back to the 1800s, is a firm favourite with visitors to the gallery in Chief Albert Luthuli Street, Pietermaritzburg, who love to watch its elaborate chiming. Webber said that being given the chance to repair the clock — which records the day of the week, the date and name of the month and automatically adjusts itself at leap years — had been a privilege. “There had been a lot of wear on the clock, so bushes have had to be drilled out and replaced.

The repairs were paid for by the Friends of Tatham Art Gallery (Fotag). The Tatham acquired the clock in 1926 when it was presented to the gallery by a former city councillor, William Harper. How he acquired it is a bit of mystery, however. It is thought that the clock was bought by Harper at Christie’s Sale Room in London in 1918, but according to one of his cousins, a Mrs H.C. Lugg, it was originally designed for an Indian Rajah, and was bought, by Harper, in Venice in 1918 for £400.
