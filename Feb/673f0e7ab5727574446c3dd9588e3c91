Beaches in KwaDukuza, on the KZN north coast, will be closed as of Friday due to bad weather and sea conditions predicted for the weekend. According to the KwaDukuza Municipality (KDM), due to the heavy sea and weather conditions forecast starting on Sunday afternoon, February 14, the number of Shark Safety Gear (SSG) was, on Friday morning, reduced at sea as a preventative measure in mitigating equipment loss and damage during this period.  “We have left the gear in the water to protect your bathing areas at Salt Rock and Thompsons Bay beaches and these beaches will remain open for bathing,” KDM said.
