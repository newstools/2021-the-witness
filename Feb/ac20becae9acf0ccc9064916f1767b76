Health MEC, Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu, said national government was in charge of speaking to pharmaceutical companies about getting and distributing vaccines. “No tenders will be issued in KZN, no tenders are in place and none are being considered at all,” she added. “Distribution will happen as soon as the vaccine has completed its quarantine and it will then go directly to all the provinces and districts.” ALSO READ | First batch of vaccines 'a major milestone' says Ramaphosa after inspecting consignment KZN’s Department of Health has chosen to send its share of the one million Astra-Zeneca vaccines, which are expected to arrive on February 14, straight to provincial hospitals and clinics.

Premier Sihle Zikalala said nurses and doctors working in direct contact with coronavirus patients will be the first to get the vaccine.
