Police Minister Bheki Cele on Friday finally replied to the burning question of why he had visited former president Jacob Zuma at his home in Nkandla on Thursday morning. Speaking during the release of the South African Quarterly Crime Statistics on Friday, Cele said he would not halve himself and speak as an ANC NEC member or as a minister. “No. I will talk things as they cross to government and as they cross to the ANC. “We spoke about some several things including all other things that are prevailing, but more so, for me to be able to report back...” He said an ‘honourable member’ had asked him why he visited a person who is about to be arrested. “I don’t know if he [Zuma] has been arrested and maybe he [the honourable member] knows what I do not know. So far, I did not visit a person that has been arrested for not appearing in the Commission, that’s one. “But another thing is that maybe it’s because this is a high profile. There are many cases where we make the visit if you can make a contribution to prevent the thing to happen before it happens and becomes a disaster if it does become a disaster,” said Cele. [sic] Cele went on to compare this situation to the Marikana massacre, which was the killing of over 30 miners by the South African Police Service in 2012, saying if something could have been done before to prevent the incident, perhaps the massacre could have been prevented. “So it was at that score to speak to the former president to raise some concerns that were raised and to hear his concerns and to see where to take those concerns for both as a responsible citizen of the country and as a person that has a responsibility that if things can be prevented, that is much better than the reaction after those things have happened,” said the police minister. In all respects, Minister Cele answered the question posed to him by members of the media, but is it clear? Cele did however clarify that he did not drink tea at Nkandla, but did have a glass of water.
