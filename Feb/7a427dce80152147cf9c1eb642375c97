Leader of the IFP, Velenkosini Hlabisa has urged the government not to rest on their laurels and said that more needed to be done to ensure that all schools have the necessary equipment and access to education that some schools across the province have enjoyed. “The class of 2020 was caught off guard and still managed to excel. In 2021 we know that we can improve and we call on the government to ensure that basic provisions are provided to all schools to combat Covid-19 which still remains present, active and poses a huge danger to our pupils,” said Hlabisa. He urged the government not to relax and said that the necessary educational equipment and tools to protect against the pandemic must be administered to all schools to balance the scales.
