A huge Rock Monitor lizard, commonly known as a 'likkewaan' was found wandering in a Ladysmith resident's backyard. Fanie Cilliers, owner and founder of Ladysmith Snake Removal was called out to the house, on Monday. "The resident sounded scared and at first could not believe he had found the large lizard about in his yard," said Cilliers. The resident reported the rock monitor to have been as large as a dog. Ciliers said that it was easy to catch the lizard and the huge reptile seemed right at home in the arms of Cilliers. "I think she knows that she is safe," added Cilliers. The 'likkewaan' was comfortable in the arms of the local snake catcher arms, even allowing Cilliers to pick off ticks and cleaning wounds. Cilliers said that there are clear markings of abuse on the body of the lizard. "Here and there you can see the lizard was beaten by a sharp object." It is believed that the lizard had moved into the residential area, looking for food. Ladysmith Herald reporter Claudine Senekal said it was strange to watch the lizard lying comfortably in the arms of Cilliers. She said one of the images captured “looks like the lizard is giving Cilliers a hug”. The lizard's weight was recorded at close to 18kg.  Cilliers said that this type of lizard is the second longest African lizard and is part of the Varanidae family. Cilliers said the 'likkewaan' is listed on the 'red list' which makes them a protected species. The 'likkewaan' will be safely released.  "They way that 'likkewaan' is looking at you, it seems that you have a new secret admirer for Valentine's month," laughed Melissa Cilliers, Fanie's wife, who helped Fanie clear the 'likkewaan's body from ticks.
