KZN MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Sipho Hlomuka on Tuesday announced the appointment of Bamba Ndwandwe as the administrator of the uMkhanyakude district municipality. Hlomuka met with the full council of the district municipality on Tuesday morning to officially inform its members of the decision taken by the Provincial Executive to place the municipality under administration in terms of Section 139(1)b of the Constitution. In the meeting, Hlomuka explained to the council that the decision to institute this intervention is the culmination of Cogta’s previous efforts to address long-term dysfunctionality at the district whose governance system has suffered due to internal divisions and failure to convene council for three consecutive scheduled meetings. “Some of the consequences of this frequent and persistent breakdown of council meetings at uMkhanyakude include the council’s failure to table completed forensic investigation reports or the municipality’s precarious cash flow position and resultant failure to meet its financial commitments” said Hlomuka. As part of the intervention, the Provincial Government has now assumed the functions specified in terms of Sections 51, 56 and 57 of the Municipal Systems Act as well as those related to financial management.   Hlomuka has urged the uMkhanyakude district council to work together with the newly appointed administrator to address the challenges that have led to the municipality being placed under administration.
