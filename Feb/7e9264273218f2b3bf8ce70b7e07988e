Residents living across Dales Park in Pietermaritzburg blocked the Mayor’s Walk Road under the bridge and burned tyres on Saturday morning over service delivery issues. Sphakamiso Nzimande, the residents’ spokesperson, said that the ward councillor and Msunduzi Municipality is not assisting address their complaints. “Over the past few months, we have been experiencing a lot of housebreakings in Howard and Logan roads. That’s because of the overgrown grass and unkept state of Dales Park,” he said. Nzimande added that the street lights are also not working. “Not one street light works. In addition, our rubbish has not been collected for two weeks,” he said. Nzimande added that they have tried to get the ward councillor to assist but he has not done anything. He said residents tried to arrange a meeting with him on Thursday but he said they need to set up an appointment two weeks in advance. Nzimande and a few other disgruntled residents went to the municipality on Friday where they met with two municipal officials. He said that these officials promised to send a team to the park to cut the grass. “They also asked us to organise volunteers to assist. We woke up early this morning and went to the park. There was no one there,” he said. This angered residents to the extent that they decided to protest. Nzimande said they are calling for the councillor to be removed and the municipality needs to start addressing their service delivery concerns. The councillor, Manqoba Ngubo, said that the matter is being attended to. “The local government elections are coming up and people are trying to instigate trouble,” he added. The municipal spokesperson was also asked to comment but did not get back to The Witness on Saturday morning.
