Nungu, who owns Uminathi medical centre in Boshoff street, is charged with allegedly orchestrating the kidnapping and attempted murder of an employee, Silindile Bhengu. According to evidence led during her earlier bail hearing it is being alleged that two men had kidnapped Bhengu - allegedly at Nungu’s behest - and threatened her, demanding to know the whereabouts of a certain exercise book. The contents of the book were not disclosed during the evidence. On Friday February 19, magistrate Nitesh Binnesarie ordered that Nungu’s R10 000 bail money be forfeited to the state as she had failed to appear in court fourteen days earlier, when a provisional warrant for her arrest had also been issued. The Witness learned that she was arrested in terms of the warrant of arrest and appeared in court yesterday (Monday) only to be released again on bail of R20 000. This was based on her explanation that she got the date for her court appearance wrong. She said she had thought she was supposed to appear in court on February 25 as this was what she’d heard, and she had phoned her attorney to confirm the date before flying to Cape Town who also confirmed to her that it was February 25. The prosecution accepted her explanation and did not oppose bail for her.
