A couple from Pretoria was this week sentenced to two life terms each for various sexual offences including the abuse of their own two children and drug possession. The 39-year-old man and 33-year-old woman were found guilty of rape, compelled rape, sexual assault, sexual grooming, flashing, child neglect and possession of drugs by the Pretoria North Regional Court on Tuesday. Lumka Mahanjana, the NPA regional spokesperson for Pretoria, said that these sexual abuse offences were committed on their five-year-old girl and an eight-year-old boy in 2014. She added that the children were found by the community policing forum at a near-by park, looking dirty, scared and hungry in August 2014. They were then taken to the police station. The children told police where they lived and when police went there, they found drugs. The couple was arrested for child neglect and for being in possession of drugs. Other charges relating to rape and sexual offences were added later after the children revealed further information of what had happened to them. The parents had pleaded not guilty to the charges. The prosecutor, Hanlie du Preez, said it was sad that children are not protected by their parents and are not safe in their own homes. The couple did not deserve to be parents therefore the prescribed sentence had to be imposed.
