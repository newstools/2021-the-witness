As many parts of Ladysmith embarked on mopping up operations
on Tuesday, streets in the KZN town were closed off to traffic as the flood
waters after heavy rain had not receded. Over 86 mm of
rain fell overnight in the Ladysmith area. Six houses situated along the Klipriver, at the bottom of
Van Riebeeck Park were flooded out (See video by Claudine Senekal, Ladysmith Herald). The water pushed over the banks of the river, closing down
Settlers Drive. Other roads in the CBD such as Forbes Street and Lyell Street were
also closed on Tuesday. Damage to cars and the inside of homes has been
reported. Public Safety officers are on the scene. A local resident was seen on a canoe saving his animals from
water that had risen up from the Klipriver. The SA Weather Service has warned of more rain for the area
on Tuesday afternoon.
