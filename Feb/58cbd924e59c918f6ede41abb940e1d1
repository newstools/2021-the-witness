Health Minister Zweli Mkhize told MPs yesterday he supports the decision to investigate the R82 million tender awarded to Digital Vibes, a company allegedly linked to the minister’s close associates. Briefing members of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) Mkhize said the Department of Health’s director-general, Sandile Buthelezi, informed him last month that the Auditor-General picked up some irregularities in tenders awarded to the company for the department’s Covid-19 projects. “In relation to Digital Vibes, he advised that the Auditor-General had raised specific findings on the deviations that were implemented and found them to be irregular,” Mkhize said After being briefed about the issue, Mkhize said, he told Buthelezi that as health minister he fully supported the decision for the tenders to be investigated. “I advised the director- general to procure the services of an external independent service provider to investigate this,” Mkhize said. Naadhira Mitha, a former assistant private secretary in Mkhize’s office, and Tahera Mather, the minister’s long-serving personal spokesperson, are alleged to have benefited from the tenders given to Digital Vibes. The Special Investigative Unit (SIU) has already announced that it is investigating the tenders. Mkhize told NCOP members that he welcomed the involvement of the SIU in the investigation. “This is part of the commitment we made that allegations of any form of corruption made must be investigated. Because these allegations have raised public interest, we do commit that the outcomes of the investigation will be accordingly reported to the public.” According to ANC conference resolutions, members who have been charged for corruption should step down from their government positions. However, as it stands, there is no evidence Mkhize is being probed for the alleged irregular tenders.
