The Comrades Marathon Association (CMA) has said that they are not in a bad financial state despite cancelling the race for the second year running due to Covid-19. This year’s Comrades Marathon was scheduled to take place on Sunday, June 13 but now they will hold a virtual race instead. In a statement sent out on Thursday, CMA chairperson Cheryl Winn said the association is currently in a very healthy financial position thanks to the prudent financial controls of the current board and the foresight of previous administrations in setting aside funds in anticipation of some future ‘rainy day.’ Also read | Cancelled Comrades Marathon a big blow but also chance to restructure running “Quite to the contrary, we are actually in a healthy financial state despite having cancelled two consecutive editions of the Comrades Marathon, owing to Covid-19 and the resultant lockdown and associated restrictions on mass participation sporting events,” said Winn. “We hosted a hugely successful inaugural virtual Comrades Marathon event last year with another one planned for the 13th of June; and are in a privileged position to also have a contingency reserve fund of over R28-million, accumulated over the past two decades, to sustain the future of our world-famous event. Winn also added that: “Reference to potential staff retrenchments is premature and unfounded and we are grateful to our staff for coming forward with workable proposals to weather the storm and continue to diligently serve the organisation in the current tough climate in which we find ourselves. “The CMA Board’s number one priority is to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of our runners, staff, volunteers, sponsors, stakeholders and fellow South Africans, while our number two priority is to sustain the Comrades Marathon as a national institution that is symbolically and economically critical to the sport of athletics in KwaZulu-Natal and South Africa, for the next 100 years. “All that the CMA is effectively and responsibly doing is tightening its purse strings and preserving all possible resources for when it is safe and possible to host the next Comrades Marathon, in line with the green light from our provincial and national athletics federations and in accordance with government regulations.” The CMA’s latest statement comes in the wake of a statement earlier in the week by the General Manager, Keletso Totlhanyo, that not having a race this year for the second year in a row was going to affect them “badly financially”.
