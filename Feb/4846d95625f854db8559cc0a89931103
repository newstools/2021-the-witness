The Department of Water and Sanitation in KwaZulu-Natal says the Umgeni Water Supply System has experienced an upsurge this week, recording 80.2% from last week’s 79.4%. When compared to a similar period last year, it recorded 64.6%. The increase of water levels in the water supply system are as a result of the recent heavy rains experienced in some parts of the province over the past three weeks. According to the department’s spokesperson Sputnik Ratau, the recent rains have also marginally increased the provincial water storage to 69.2% this week from 67.5% last week. “When we compare what the provincial storage capacity was this time last year, we note that it was slightly lower at 60.0%,” said Ratau. Hluhluwe Dam has increased from 95.1% to 102.4%. Woodstock Dam on the Tugela River is up from last week’s 98.3% to 101.6% this week. Spioenkop Dam is at 100.6% from 100.8% in the previous week. On the Umgeni Water Supply System, Midmar Dam is at 100.3% from last week’s 100.5%. Meanwhile Albert-Falls has increased from 44.4% to 46.0%. Spring Grove Dam is up at 78.5% from 75.5%. However, Nagle Dam has slightly decreased from 98.5% to 93.2%. Inanda Dam is at 101.4% from 101.6%. Unchanged are Driel Barrage (88.1%) and Zaaihoek (73.1%) Dams. Ratau reiterated the Department’s assurance to the public that most of the country’s dams are built to handle floods. This comes amid heavy flooding in some parts of the province which has filled up some dams to full capacity and also leaving a trail of destruction for residents. “The recent rains have been a both a blessing and a curse. Filling up most dams while at the same time, leaving many people homeless. It is for this very reason that we are working very closely with the provincial government to bring relief to communities in need,” he said. Ratau added that the Department forms part of the National Disaster Management Centre where it shares data on any potential disaster during floods. “We have highly specialised officials who are in the field on a daily basis, monitoring rivers and dam levels in order to plan for possible water releases from dams as a flood control precautionary measure,” he said. He also advised the public to stay away from overflowing watercourses as this can result in the loss of life.
