The South African Weather Service (Saws) has warned of thundershowers and disruptive rainfall from Friday afternoon into the weekend, possibly extending into Monday. The weather service said the weather conditions are due a tropical low pressure system situated along the Mozambique coast which is expected to move slowly east south-east and will result in continuous onshore flow into the north eastern parts of KZN. This will bring scattered to widespread showers and thundershowers causing disruptive rainfall from Friday afternoon into the weekend, possibly extending into Monday.   The weather conditions are expected to cause localised flooding of formal and informal settlements as well as low lying areas and bridges, damage to infrastructure of mud-based houses. Flooding of major roads expected, along with difficult driving conditions on dirt roads and possible mudslides with possible loss of livestock and damage to crops. People are urged to stay indoors and off the roads, avoid crossing rivers and swollen streams where water is above your ankles. If trapped in a vehicle during a flood, Saws advices that you abandon it and climb to higher ground.
