The drought on official news on Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini's health has ended. Since the announcement of King Goodwill Zwelithini's admission to hospital on Sunday, with no official updates having been provided since then, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi said several false rumours had begun circulating that the King’s health is being kept a secret, and even, “most cruelly, that His Majesty is no more.” Buthelezi said he and those close to the King have been inundated with calls, seeking an update. “I wish to allay the concerns of the nation regarding these fables. His Majesty entered hospital to attend to high Glucose levels. He was not, and is still not, frail in any way. Even this morning, he is fully mobile and is continuing treatment for unstable Glucose. His doctors preferred that he be treated in ICU in order to attend to this thoroughly. “One wonders what kind of people would start such cruel false rumours that His Majesty has passed, when he is most certainly alive. It has inflicted tremendous pain on the Royal Family and on all those who wish the King of the Zulu Nation well. “Unfortunately, such grossly irresponsible behaviour has been seen before. Even I myself have been declared dead while I am still alive, once by no less than a senior SABC journalist. In the age of social media, false news is disseminated like wildfire. “One can only hope that those who report the news on official channels would have the discernment to treat such serious matters on the basis of fact,” said Buthelezi.
