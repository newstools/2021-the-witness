Two people were arrested on Saturday after they were bust on the R66 transporting alcohol from Pongolo to Mashona and Mahlabathini in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Captain Nqobile Gwala said the Zululand District Task Team was conducting an operation on Saturday afternoon, January 30, near Mkhuze River when they pulled over a bakkie with two occupants. “The vehicle was stopped, and a search was conducted. Upon searching the vehicle, it was discovered that the occupants were transporting liquor. The vehicle was traveling from Pongola and the liquor was destined to be delivered at Mashona and Mahlabathini,” said Gwala.
