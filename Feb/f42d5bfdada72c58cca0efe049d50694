Msunduzi municipal firefighters responded quickly to a fire in a two-storey house in Berg Street in Pietermritzburg’s CBD shortly before 2 pm on Friday. The firemen were able to contain the blaze which destroyed at least four rooms on the top floor, sources said. Residents of the building were able to vacate the premises and no-one was hurt said one of the occupants of the house. It is not known exactly how many people live in the building but there are a number of tenants. “The fire started because we left the stove on,” a woman said, adding that the fire was quickly put out by the firemen. Another resident said most valuables from the building were salvaged and the bottom storey did not have any major damage. Firemen could be seen both outside and inside the building as they pumped water into the top floor of the building. Firemen say that luckily there was a firewall in the building otherwise more would have been lost. They said they are short on manpower, an issue that they have been raising with Msunduzi municipality.
