Sharks coach Sean Everitt on Friday decided to rest some stars and give others game-time when he named his team to face Griquas in their opening match of the “preparation series” in Durban on Sunday. The eight-team tournament has been created by SA Rugby to help South African franchises prepare for the Europe-linked Rainbow Cup’s launch in April. Everitt’s men will welcome Griquas to Kings Park at 5.15 pm on Sunday. There is a mixture of regular players, reserves and youngsters in Everitt’s side for the game. Top-scoring flyhalf Curwin Bosch is among the absentees, as is new signing Siya Kolisi. Lukhanyo Am will also not feature in the game and this means the armband goes to Jeremy Ward. However, there are “welcome returns from injury” for hooker Kerron van Vuuren and loose forward James Venter. Starting this weekend, Everitt is using his free license to add to his squad depth by “affording all his players an opportunity to get valuable game-time” ahead of the Rainbow Cup tournament. Sunday’s match comes a month since the Sharks were last in action, when they finished runners-up to the powerful Bulls in the Carling Currie Cup final in Pretoria. The first round of matches in the new domestic tournament kicks off on Friday with the Lions hosting the Pumas in Johannesburg. On Saturday, the Stormers take on the Cheetahs at Cape Town Stadium at 5.15 pm, while Sunday features the Bulls at home to Eastern Province in Pretoria at 3 pm and then the Sharks entertain Griquas. All the matches will be screened live on SuperSport. SHARKS TEAM: 1. Khwezi Mona 2. Kerron van Vuuren 3. Michael Kumbirai 4. JJ vd Mescht 5. Hyron Andrews 6. James Venter 7. Thembelani Bholi 8.
