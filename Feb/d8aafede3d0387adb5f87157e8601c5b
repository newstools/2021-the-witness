Government transport for pupils has been derailed due to a lack of funds, and only about a third of pupils who rely on the scholar transport programme can be helped. Acting KZN MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison Kwazi Mshengu said yesterday his department and the Department of Education are supposed to be transporting over 150 000 pupils through the scholar transport programme but only 42 000 pupils are currently benefitting. The MEC was in Port Shepstone to inspect school transport ahead of the reopening of schools next week. Mshengu added that they will request more funding. Mshengu said in the next cabinet meeting, the provincial executive council will be submitting the scholar transport policy for approval. He said 70% of KZN’s schools are in rural areas and pupils have to travel long distances through unsafe routes to get to school. He said all pupils who walk further than three kilometres to school are deserving of scholar transport, but warned government has to prioritise pupils according to distances, age and disabilities. The MEC said once cabinet approves the policy, it will be made available to the public. Speaking at the Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI) Offices in Port Shepstone, Mshengu said so far they are happy with the safety of the buses they saw at Ugu transport depot. “On the testing grounds, we also saw a number of school minibuses undergoing roadworthiness testing. This is going to happen throughout the country so that by February 15, we are all sure that our learners are using safe transport,” said Mshengu. Mshengu said they are certain that everything will be ready when pupils go back to school, including deliveries of masks and sanitisers to schools.
