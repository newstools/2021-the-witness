A man was left critically injured after his car crashed into a stationary car on the M19 Durban bound, after the Dunkeld Road bridge on Tuesday. Rescue Care spokesperson, Sheldon Lombard, said the man was trapped in his car. “…It is believed that the patient somehow lost control of his vehicle and collided with a stationary vehicle next to the road,” said Lombard. He said the man had suffered critical injuries and required advanced life support care. He was extricated by the Rescue Care's Rescue Unit as well as the eThekwini Fire Department and was then airlifted by Netcare 911's aeromedical crews to hospital.
