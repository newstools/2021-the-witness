Witnesses said the exploding tyres on a truck, which caught fire, sounded like hand grenades. Traffic on the N3 southbound, near Ashburton and the Lion Park Bridge, on Sunday morning was disrupted as emergency services dealt with the blaze. The driver managed to escape from the burning truck, but reportedly lost R4 000 in cash, his ID book, passport and bank cards. The cause of the blaze is not yet known, but sources told The Witness it could have been caused by the brakes overheating.
