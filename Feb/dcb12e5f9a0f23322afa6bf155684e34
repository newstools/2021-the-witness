Social media has been abuzz following Julius Malema’s Tweet on Wednesday asking if he can have tea with former president Jacob Zuma. In their public tweets, the pair suggested that a meeting between them is imminent, possibly this weekend. The EFF leader, Malema, proposed a tea date with Zuma this weekend at Zuma's Nkandla homestead. He wrote, “@PresJGZuma can we please have tea urgently?” A few hours later Zuma responded, extending an invitation to his once political rival. “Thobela Moshabi. I have seen your request to share a cup of tea. As you know, Nkandla village is home for me and that is where my time is spent these days. Tea I have plenty of, you are more than welcome to come over for a cup,” he said. Malema said their meeting was a “meeting of national importance.” Malema’s request comes a few days after Zuma said he would defy a Constitutional Court order that he appear before — and answer questions at — the state capture commission later this month. Twitter users have had a lot to say about #MalemaMeetsZuma tea date set to happen this weekend.
