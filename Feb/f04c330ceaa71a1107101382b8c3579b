The overnight heavy rains in the province resulted in three people being killed. Two men, Simo Mkhize (28) and Nathi Mbatha (25), from an informal settlement in Siyanda near KwaMashu in Durban, died when a wall collapsed on their home. One of the responders, IPSS Medical Rescuesâ€™ Search and Rescue division reported that three dwellings were engulfed by rubble, following the collapse of a wall and embankment. The two bodies were recovered by rescue teams. In addition to the two deaths, one person sustained moderate injuries and was taken to hospital. In a separate incident, a person from KwaMyeko in Mtubatuba died after being swept away while trying to cross a low-lying bridge that was flooded. The body was recovered by the community further downstream. In response to the several incidents that were reported all over the province, KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Sipho Hlomuka has deployed disaster management teams. Hlomuka has sent his condolences to the families of the three victims. The MEC has also directed disaster management teams to continue to monitor areas that are prone to flooding as the inclement weather conditions are expected to continue. He has also welcomed the declaration of national state of disaster, by the national Minister of Cogta Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, for areas that were affected by strong winds and floods due to tropical storm Eloise and summer rains. The Gazette which was signed by the Dlamini-Zuma on Wednesday paves the way for a raft of measures to be implemented by organs of state and municipalities in addressing the extensive destruction left by the storms. The damages experienced by the province since January 24, are estimated at R989 million.
