A six-year-old girl was killed after being struck by lightning on Wednesday afternoon while in the yard of her home in Madiba Village in Ward 10 of the Maphumulo Local Municipality. KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Sipho Hlomuka expressed his concern about the loss of life the province continues to witness as a result of the prevailing inclement weather conditions. Hlomuka conveyed his condolences to the child’s family, the Manqele’s, for their loss and directed disaster management teams to provide support to the grieving family. “The news we have received of yet another life lost as a result of inclement weather is devastating. We appeal to all communities to be vigilant as our province continues to experience rough weather conditions which pose a significant risk to human life,” said Hlomuka. The MEC said the province has lost 11 lives since the heavy storms struck on January 24. Two people are still missing since they were swept off the uThukela Bridge between Kranskop and Nkandla on February 12. Search and rescue teams deployed a helicopter to assist with the search for Smakade Magwaza (62) and his grandson Lwandle Magwaza (8) who were swept away by the crocodile-infested uThukela River. Hlomuka said the department continues to invest in additional disaster management capacity in municipalities so that they can better respond to natural disasters and weather-related incidents. On Wednesday, Hlomuka visited the Ilembe District where he handed over a fully equipped fire and rescue vehicle to the rural municipality of Ndwedwe so that it can better manage such incidents and be able to assist other municipalities in the district.
