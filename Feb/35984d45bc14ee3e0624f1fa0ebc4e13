Speaking during his address to the nation on Monday night,
President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that alcohol sales are now permitted. Ramaphosa said the government is steadily easing
restrictions under adjusted Level 3. He said restrictions on the sale of alcohol will be eased.
The sale of alcohol by licensed premises for off-site consumption will be
permitted from Mondays to Thursdays, from 10 am to 6 pm. The hours of the curfew will now be from 11 pm to 4 am.
Establishments will need to close by 10 pm to allow their customers and staff
to return home by curfew. The President said faith-based gatherings will be permitted,
subject to health protocols. “Such gatherings may not exceed 50 people for indoor venues
and 100 people for outdoor venues. Where the venue is too small to accommodate
these numbers with appropriate social distancing, then no more than 50 percent
of the capacity of the venue may be used,” said Ramaphosa. He reiterated that it remains compulsory for every person to
wear a mask in a public space.
