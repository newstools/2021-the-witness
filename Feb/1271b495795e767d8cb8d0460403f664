Whilst the country remains on a Level 3 lockdown, police
together with other security forces continue with multi-disciplinary operations
across the province to deal with those that do not comply with the lockdown
regulations. Because of operations carried out from December 29 last year
until February 21, 14 653 people were arrested for various contraventions of
the Level 3 lockdown regulations in the province. During the same period, 10 701 people were arrested in
various public spaces for not wearing a mask. Police said they arrested 2 884 people who have failed to
comply with the curfew set in the regulations. Operations also netted 741
people who were found transporting, selling or consuming alcohol in a public
space, which is in contravention of the regulations. The police said security forces remain especially concerned
with the high number of people who are arrested on a daily basis for not
wearing a mask in public spaces. They appealed to people to maintain social
distancing as this does not seem to be happening as hordes of people are
observed congregating at shopping malls and other public spaces on a daily
basis. The Acting Provincial Commissioner for KwaZulu-Natal, Major
General Thulani Gonya has urged police officers to continue with the clampdown
on those who are not complying with the adjusted alert Level 3 Lockdown
regulations. “We will continue to do our part to ensure that citizens in
the province comply with the regulations to stem the spread of the Covid-19
virus. We are urging citizens to comply with the regulations to avoid being
exposed to the Covid-19 virus. People are also advised to avoid going to
shopping malls and other crowded spaces unnecessarily,” he said. Gonya also urged anyone with information with regards to
contraventions of the adjusted alert Level 3 Lockdown regulations to please
contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or report contraventions anonymously via the
MySAPSApp.
