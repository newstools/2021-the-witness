The Comrades Marathon Association (CMA) on Wednesday confirmed that the popular race will not be staged this year. As indicated in the Witness a fortnight ago, Covid-19 has caused complications with qualifying criteria for the Comrades, with the result that the gruelling but much-loved ultra marathon is now not happening for the second consecutive year. This represents a major sporting and financial blow not only to CMA, but the region. The CMA “regrettably announced its decision to cancel the Comrades Marathon scheduled for 13 June 2021” at lunch on Wednesday.  “This decision comes in the wake of engagements with KwaZulu-Natal Athletics, Athletics South Africa, the National Coronavirus Command Council, members of the medical fraternity and governmental departments; and was both a moral and practical imperative given the ongoing uncertainty and unprecedented circumstances of the Coronavirus pandemic, the onset of a second wave and a significantly more infectious variant of Covid-19, as well as the ongoing National State of Disaster and its associated restrictions.” However, Comrades centenary celebrations will go ahead. With the very first Comrades having been held on Tuesday, 24 May 1921, the CMA will launch the celebrations on Monday, May 24, 2021. The organisation also said: “Other great news is that the CMA has confirmed that its 2nd Comrades Marathon virtual event will take place on Sunday, 13 June 2021 in which runners will be able to run in any location, outside in their garden, or neighbourhood, all at their own pace, in a similar fashion to last year’s successful inaugural Race the Comrades Legends which saw 43,788 participants from more than 100 nations uniting in a single virtual event.” Details of the virtual event, the centenary celebrations and “other innovative festivities which are in the pipeline” will be confirmed in coming weeks.
