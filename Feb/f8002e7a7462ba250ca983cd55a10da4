Argument has yet again been adjourned in the case of former KwaZulu-Natal primary school guidance counsellor, Darren Goddard, who allegedly sexually assaulted and raped boys. Goddard has pleaded not guilty to 15 charges in total - one of accessing child pornography, another of being in possession of child pornography, and the rest of sexual assault and rape.

Goddard was the guidance counsellor at a local primary school in Pietermaritzburg at the time. Argument was supposed to take place on Tuesday morning before Pietermaritzburg High Court Judge Kate Pillay via Zoom and had been set down for two days. State prosecutor Attie Trutter said in the Zoom meeting that he is not ready with his heads of argument. He said he is battling with the portion of evidence that was given when he was not the prosecutor. The Witness reported in 2018 that the initial prosecutor in the case withdrew over what was said about a document - the contents of which were not disclosed in court.

Yesterday, Judge Pillay suggested that Trutter get the court’s transcribing company to cut CDs if he can’t get the recordings transcribed. “We need to start finalising the matter as soon as possible,” said the Judge. She suggested that written heads of arguments from the defence and state be presented to her and then a Zoom meeting can be arranged if she needs to be addressed on certain aspects. The case has now been provisionally adjourned to February 25.
