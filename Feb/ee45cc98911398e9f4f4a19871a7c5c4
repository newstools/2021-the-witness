Springbok captain Siya Kolisi’s new contract with the Sharks and his role in the Durban rugby outfit is set to be revealed on Wednesday. After the inspirational player and Western Province officially said farewell to each other at the weekend, the Sharks have called a press conference for Wednesday morning where Kolisi is due to be the star attraction. The Sharks confirmed last week that they were in discussions with Kolisi, but said they were not prepared to pay any compensation to Western Province even though they developed his career. Transfer fees generally don’t apply in rugby, and Kolisi is now a free agent, but WP are sorry to lose the Bok skipper after a spell of 11 years with him. Kolisi is not expected to be announced as the new captain of the Sharks in place of Lukhanyo Am during Wednesday’s conference, but the length of his contract and preferred position in the side is set to be disclosed. With the 29-year-old having roughly five years left of shelf life, it will be interesting to see exactly what deal he gets from the Sharks. It will probably take him up to the next World Cup in 2023 in France, at least. Kolisi’s first training session with the Sharks is set to take place next Monday, when coach Sean Everitt’s Currie Cup runners-up start preparing for a preliminary tournament that SA Rugby have created to get South African franchises warmed up for the forthcoming Rainbow Cup that will involve European sides.
