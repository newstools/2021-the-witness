Durban residents are warned to be aware of housebreaking
gangs disguised as workmen and wearing blue overalls in a ruse to enter
properties illegally. The warning follows an incident in Durban North on Friday
when two people entered a property in Danville Avenue, dressed in blue
overalls. “The suspects approached the domestic worker and threatened
her with a knife,” said Blue Security spokesperson Andreas Mathios. The employee was able to escape the men and run to a
neighbour to raise the alarm and inform them of the incident. “The suspects fled in the direction of Virginia Bush with
one cellphone," Mathios said. In a separate incident, Mathios said in the early hours of
Saturday morning, Blue Security successfully arrested two housebreaking suspects
in the Manor Gardens area. "The men were positively identified by a resident in
the same complex as the same suspects who broke into his premises and stole his
flatscreen TV and stabbed his domestic worker," Mathios said. He said at the time of their arrest the suspects were
wearing the same sneakers that they had previously stolen from his property. The suspected criminals were handed over to Mayville SAPS
for further investigation and processing.
