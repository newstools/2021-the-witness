The KwaZulu-Natal Sports Confederation believe the inclusion of netball star Precious Mthembu as a member of their executive council will improve the relationship between the organisation and athletes. The 36-year-old Mthembu has been co-opted onto the 14-member exco and is designated as the chairperson of the Athletes Commission. The provincial confederation held elections in November last year where 10 members were elected to the executive committee and they had to co-opt four more members last week. Mthembu’s duties include looking after the welfare of athletes and their development. The president of the confederation Thami Mchunu, who is from Pietermaritzburg’s Imbali township, said they are thrilled to have Mthembu serving on the exco as her leadership skills will help her tackle her responsibilities successfully. “Precious has been a netball player for the national team for quite a number of years, at the same time she has been the captain of the Kingdom Stars for a number of years,” said Mchunu, while Mthembu was not available for comment. As a member of the national team, she has not been a captain, but she got the experience of being led there. “So, she understands being a leader and being led as well. “She has an all-round experience which is why we believed she will excel in the role of looking after her peers. “She knows their problems and what they need to complete their duties.”
