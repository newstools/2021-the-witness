Former President Jacob Zuma’s corruption trial on charges of fraud, racketeering and money laundering linked to his role in the arms deal in the 1990s is set to start in May following a three-year delay. The Pietermaritzburg High Court on Tuesday set May 17 as the start of the trial. Zuma is charged along French arms company, Thales. Neither Zuma nor the French company’s representatives were in court as the proceedings were about the finalisation of the trial date. “The matter was postponed (in absentia in respect of Mr. Zuma and the Thales’ representative) to 17 May 2021 until 20 June 2021,” National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) provincial spokesperson, Natasha Ramkisson-Kara, said. Should dates change in the future, Ramkisson-Kara said, the court would decide on the way forward. She said any further dates will be determined by the Judge presiding at the trial and the Judge President, "subject to further clarity on the resumption of international travel under the COVID 19 restrictions, which may affect witnesses and the Thales representative, Mr. Durand, from abroad". Zuma’s JG Zuma Foundation issued a press statement on Monday complaining about the delays in the court proceedings. However, the NPA said the delays were not the prosecuting body’s doing as both Zuma and Thales had been challenging the NPA’s decision to charge them. Zuma is facing 18 charges of corruption in connection with his involvement in the arms deal.
