Despite the challenges of the Covid-19 lockdown, pupils in KwaZulu-Natal achieved an overall pass mark of 77,6% in the 2020 matric exams. While this is a decline of 3,7 percentage points from 2019, it is still slightly higher than the national average for the National Senior Certificate of 76,2%. The province placed fourth in the country — behind the Free State (85,1%), Gauteng (83,3%) and the Western Cape (83,3%). Tshwane South in Gauteng was named the best performing district for the second year in a row. It was one of six districts in that province in the top 10. Ugu on the South Coast was named the best performing district in KZN. The 2020 academic year will be remembered for the massive disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, which resulted in school closures, a move to online lessons and the cancellation of the June exams. The November exams meanwhile were compromised when the Mathematics and Physical Science papers were leaked online. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga said that, given the unprecedented challenges faced by pupils, teachers and Education Department officials, the results could have been a lot worse. She added that while it was disappointing that the overall pass rate had dropped 5,1 percentage points from the record 81,3% achieved in 2019, the class of 2020 had to be commended for its resilience and hard work. “This represents a record of 440 702 passes — an increase of 7,5% in the number of passes from 2019,” Motshekga added. “Without the progressed learners, the overall pass rate stands at 81,2% — a 1,1% decline from 2019.” The minister was also happy with the 36,4% bachelor (university entrance) passes achieved by pupils, which was slightly down from the 36,9% achieved in 2019. “We appreciate the unquestionable resilience our school community has shown against such a devastating pandemic,” Motshekga said. “We are of the strong view that, had it not been for the novel Covid-19 pandemic, the class of 2020 could have been the best performers since the inception of the NSC.” The minister also paid tribute to the country’s principals, teachers and support staff, who ensured that pupils were able to write their final exams. “Schools are at the coalface of basic education delivery,” Motshekga said. “What you do at the school level, is what matters the most. The future of our learners, and the prosperity of our nation, is in your hands. We applaud you for the great work you continue to do on a daily basis.” IFP spokesperson on basic education Siphosethu Ngcobo also congratulated pupils “on a job well done”, saying: “The learners and staff of 2020 must be commended for soldiering on through the tough conditions created due to the Covid-19 pandemic.” The DA, by contrast, accused the Department of Basic Education and Motshekga of fudging the figures, saying that the real matric pass rate was 44,1%. Baxolile “Bax” Nodada MP, shadow minister of basic education, said: “While the DA congratulates every matric from the class of 2020 who have passed after the incredible difficult year they had and commiserates with those who were not successful this time around, the minister surely cannot hope to get away with this subterfuge. “The fact of the matter is that the real matric pass rate is 44,1%, which is calculated by comparing the number of learners that enrolled in 2018 — which was 997 872 — to the number that wrote (578 468) and passed matric in 2020, 440 702 learners. “The serious concerns plaguing the South African basic education system will never be addressed if the department continues to try and bury the truth of their ineptitude.”
