Best friends, Nhlanhla Mhlongo (22) and Sakhile Cele (25) appeared in the KwaDukuza Magistrate’s Court for the robbery and murder of a tuckshop owner on Wednesday. They were remanded in custody until February 23 for a bail application. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said the pair was arrested on February 14, at Doringkop area, in Stanger. She said it was alleged that they attacked the tuckshop owner, Goberdhan Sahadew (74), at his Holmbosch Farm on February 6. “They locked the door, assaulted, strangled and stabbed the victim once on the chest. They took his cellphones, shotgun, cash and other items and drove away in his vehicle. “The vehicle was later found abandoned not far from the crime scene. Customers who found Sahadew’s lifeless body had spotted the bloodstains outside the yard and informed the police.” Mbele said charges of murder and robbery were opened at the KwaDukuza police for investigation. The investigation by the detectives led them to Doringkop, where the two men were hiding. The acting KwaZulu-Natal provincial commissioner, Major General Thulani Gonya, commended the KwaDukuza detectives for the arrest and emphasised that the police officers would not rest until all law breakers were behind bars.
