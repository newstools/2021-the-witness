Hlomuka has also warned residents to not cross rivers but instead use safer options. “We are concerned with the reports that we have received and want to appeal to all residents to continue to be vigilant. Large bodies of water are very dangerous, and one must not attempt to cross a river since the strength of the current could be very strong” said Hlomuka.
