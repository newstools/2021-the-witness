Taxi drivers have blocked the R103, near the Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI) offices, in Mooi River. According Mooi River Crime Watch, the tollgate onto the N3 Durban-bound is also closed off. Sinhle Mali, spokesperson for the RTI, confirmed the protest action and said she understood the taxi operators were unhappy about permits. According to Philip Ndlovu, a representative of the Mooi River Taxi Association, however, itâ€™s not a permit issue. Instead owners and operators are at believed to be at odds over who should be allowed to operate local routes. The SAPS are monitoring the situation. Motorists are advised to avoid the R103 and use alternate routes.
