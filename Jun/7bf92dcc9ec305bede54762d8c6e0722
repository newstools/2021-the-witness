Centre Jeremy Ward is set to lead the Sharks when they return to Currie Cup action against Western Province on Wednesday in Cape Town. The mid-week game that is scheduled for Cape Town Stadium will start at 7 pm and the Durbanites head to the match with three changes to their starting line-up. The Sharks are looking to extend their winning run to two matches in a row after they got off their campaign to a winning start against the Griquas last week. However, they will have to do so without their new skipper Phendulani “Phepsi” Buthelezi who was not considered for selection due to concussion. With Buthelezi out, Mpilo Gumede takes over the No.8 jersey in the only change to the forward pack. The other two changes in the backline will see star flyhalf Curwin Bosch making a return after being rested for the first round while Thaakir Abrahams replaces the injured Anthony Volmink on the left wing. “We have to look at the Currie Cup in two ways: we want to win it, make no mistake about it, but at the same time, we do have to grow our squad and this double-round competition does allow us to give opportunities to players because you can always rectify results if one week it didn’t go your way,” said Sharks coach Sean Everitt.
