Power supply has not been restored in some parts of Esikhaleni area, outside Empangeni, in Northern KwaZulu-Natal, after angry protesters vandalised municipal and Eskom infrastructure during a service delivery protest this week. A local electricity transformer was vandalised, and this has plunged the whole cluster into chaos and darkness. The affected areas are Madlankala, Emkhoboza, Madukwini, Mabuyeni and Ndindima. The angry residents took to the streets on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning complaining about water shortages in Esikhaleni. One of the resident told The Witness that taps have been left dry in Esikhaleni for over a month, leaving scores of communities with no water. “We are being fed with the same line that water pumps are not working. This week residents took to the street and raise their concerns. “It’s very frustrating to wake up in the morning only to find out that there’s no water. We are going to continue protesting until Eskom and the municipality listen to us.” Spokesperson for uMhlathuze Municipality, Mduduzi Ncalane, said power supply has been restored partly in some parts of Esikhaleni. “We have started pumping in our plant. In some areas power has not been restored because of spares in transformers that were burnt,” Ncalane said. UMhlathuze’s Mayor Mduduzi Mhlongo, said power cuts in eSikhaleni had hugely affected water pumping system. “This is now leading to the water interruptions because the whole of eSikhaleni Cluster is supplied by Cubhu Lake that has no power. The blockages of the roads and burning of municipal and government infrastructure now prevents our municipal vehicles to even send diesel to the generators at Cubhu which then means we are not pumping a single drop to the system,”Mhlongo said. *This is a developing story.
