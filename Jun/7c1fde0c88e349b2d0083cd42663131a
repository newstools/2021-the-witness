Msunduzi Municipality obtained a temporary interdict on Friday morning to put a stop to the protest action taking place at the Manor Gardens Flats, Pietermaritzburg. The application was brought on an urgent basis by advocates Chris Snyman, SC, and Nooreen Nursoo and granted by Pietermaritzburg High Court Judge Thoba Poyo-Dlwati. General manager of sustainable development, Felix Thembinkosi Nxumalo, said in court papers there are 200 residential flats and all are illegally occupied. “The reason why I say that the flats are illegally occupied is because approximately 90% of the occupiers do not pay rent or electricity at all for many years.” The protest action started on Wednesday. He said the protesters apparently don’t want to pay any rent or for electricity usage. They simply want to stay on the municipal properties free of charge. Nxumalo added that they are also demanding the title deeds of the flats in which they are staying. The protesters owe the municipality about R31 million. The monthly income that the municipality should receive from the protesters is R1.3 million per month, but the municipality only receives R400 000 monthly. The protesters have been ordered not to gather or organise any violent and unlawful protest action, and not to burn tyres, logs or any substance and/or other material on any public or private road within the municipality’s municipal area. They have also been ordered not to block access on any road for motor vehicles and pedestrians. In addition, they have also been prevented from intimidating, assaulting or threatening municipal employees or any other member of the public as part of protest action. If they fail to abide by the order then the municipality has been given consent to turn to the courts again for subsequent relief. The court papers will be served on any of the ringleaders of the protest action, if possible.
