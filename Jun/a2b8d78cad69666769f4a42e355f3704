Motorists are advised to be cautious and to try and use alternate routes when approaching the Mkondeni area due to ongoing protest action on Wednesday morning. Msunduzi Municipality’s spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha told The Witness they had received reports on Tuesday that the SACCA informal settlement residents, most of whom are Truda Foods employees, would be blocking all roads and burning tyres in the area. “According to our contact, they started as early as 3 am. “Truda foods employees will also be picketing from 6 am to 6 pm during the protected strike today,” said Mafumbatha. She added that the relevant roleplayers have been informed of the strike and currently, general patrols are being conducted. Ward councillor for the area Johann Winterbach said the roads affected are Yarborough Road, Lester Brown Road, Thomas Watkins Road and Haworth Road. “The protest action is being contained at present so please stay clear of the above listed roads,” said Winterbach. This protest follows another major protest in the city on Tuesday where taxi operators blocked several main roads in protest against e-hailing taxis operating without permits.
