Four men, allegedly linked to the gang which has been terrorising residents in Pietermaritzburg and surrounding areas of the city, were arrested by police on Sunday. Colonel Thembeka Mbele, spokesperson for the SAPS in KwaZulu-Natal, said the men were caught following an intelligence driven operation which took place in the Alexandra policing area. "The SAPS team, which has been tracing these gangs, received information of the whereabouts of the gang," Mbele said, adding that officers headed to a lodge in Woodhouse Road, not far where seven gang members were killed last week. "The team pounced on unsuspecting males and four were placed under arrest," Mbele said. "Each suspect was [allegedly] found in possession of illegal pistol with rounds of ammunition. "They are aged between 18 and 30 ... [and] are linked to a string of murder cases that were committed in the Pietermaritzburg, Imbali, Richmond, Bergville, as well as robbery, rape and assault with the purpose to inflict grievous bodily harm. "The suspects will appear in the Pietermaritzburg Magistratesâ€™ Court tomorrow." The SAPS believes the men are part of a gang of criminals who have terrorised those living in the Pietermaritzburg district. "We will not rest until we arrest all those that are linked in causing the instability in the Pietermaritzburg and in the province," KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi said. "Our operations are still on-going and all those that are involved in these criminal acts including those high profile individuals (business people and politicians) will be arrested. We will not rest until there is peace and stability in our province.
