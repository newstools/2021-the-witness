 An onslaught of gunshots could be heard as police exchange fire with criminals on the run in the Bishopstowe area, Pietermaritzburg, on Monday. RZS Security owner Radley Govender said that four men were en route to Pietermaritzburg from Durban on Monday morning via the Table Mountain route when police intercepted them. “Two suspects were killed this morning and two are still on the loose among the sugar cane plantation here,” said Govender, adding the men were found with a firearm believed to belong to a police officer who was killed recently. Police have cordoned off the road leading into the area and active gunshots can be heard being fired in all directions. The scene is still active with police currently engaged in a shootout with the remaining men. The Witness is still awaiting official comment from the police, and the Bishopstowe community has been advised to be vigilant and safe.  This is a developing story
