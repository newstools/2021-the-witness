“No crime is too small to be reported to the police.” This is the advice of KwaDukuza SAPS spokesperson, Priya Nunkumar, who has urged victims of crime have been urged to open cases at their nearest police station in an effort to get justice and create a safe and secure environment for everyone. “Each one of us can play a role in curbing crime. It is very important that crimes are reported at your closest station. This will assist SAPS members in arresting the perpetrators, which will break the vicious cycle of crime,” Nunkumar said. She said while informative messages posted on social media posts and WhatsApp may immediately create public awareness on the crime committed, law enforcement authorities still have to be alerted. She said social media messages are not effective enough to combat crime within the area if the victim does not open a case. Nunkumar said circulating information on social media messages “does not aid the members of the SAPS with sufficient information in their investigations which could possibly lead to the arrest a perpetrator.” KwaDukuza SAPS station commander, Brigadier Sibongile Mhlongo echoed Nunkumar’s sentiments about the importance of reporting crime to the police, no matter how small the incident might seem.
