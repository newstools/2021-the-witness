President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday afternoon placed embattled Health Minster Dr Zweli Mkhize on special leave. This is in light of the R150 million communications tender awarded by the Department of Health to Digital Vibes, a company linked to Mkhizeâ€™s close associates. Ramaphosa said this period of special leave will enable Mkhize to attend to allegations and investigations concerning contracts between the Department of Health and Digital Vibes. The Special Investigating Unit is also investigating the controversial Digital Vibes' tender and Ramaphosa awaits a report on the outcome of this probe. Tourism Minister, Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane, will serve as acting minister of health until further notice from the presidency.
