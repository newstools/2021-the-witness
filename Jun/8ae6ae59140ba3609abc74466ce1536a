Embattled Health Minister, Zweli Mkhize, is considering taking special leave in the wake of the R150 million tender awarded by the Department of Health to a company linked to his close associates. Briefing the media in Kimberly, Northern Cape, during a tour of vaccination sites on Tuesday, Mkhize said he was awaiting President Cyril Ramaphosa to make a decision about after reports that the tender was irregularly awarded to Digital Vibes, a company controlled by his associates. “The president has actually discussed with me the issue of the special leave. I think we must give space to the president to do what he needs to do,” he said. This comes amid mounting calls for Mkhize, who is also due to meet the ANC integrity commission over the tender, to resign from his top government position. The tender, which was for communication work around the National Health Insurance (NHI) and the department’s response to Covid-19, is currently being investigated by the Special Investigative Unit (SIU). It has since been alleged that Mkhize and his family members directly benefited from the tender, with Digital Vibes having paid for renovations at a home owned by the minister’s family trust. The company also allegedly purchased a second hand bakkie for Mkhize’s son, Dedani.
