A 31-year-old woman and her baby are in a critical condition in hospital after an urn used to boil water fell on them at their home in Phoenix, Durban, on Tuesday. The woman and her one-year-old daughter sustained burn injuries to their lower body. According to Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa), the woman was in the process of carrying an urn from the kitchen to the bathroom when the handle broke which resulted in water falling on her and the baby. When Rusa officers arrived at the scene, the woman informed them that she had boiled water to take a bath when an urn broke. She sustained severe burns to both her legs. Her daughter was also in the kitchen at the time and sustained burns to her feet. The two were treated at the scene before being transported to hospital by ambulance.
