A case of arson is being investigated by the police as firefighters battled two fires in Ladysmith on Thursday night. Alfred Duma Municipality firefighters fought two raging fires that completely destroyed a house in Spinner Road and the Bawas Furniture factory store along Illing Road on Thursday evening. The house fire on Spinner Road sent shock waves throughout the neighbourhood, as residents watched in disbelief as high flames and billowing black smoke ripped through the house. Two local security officers, who had continued patrols in the area, stopped to help residents remove their vehicles from the garage and ensure that all family members were taken safely out of the house. “We had to break the vehicle windows to gain entry to try and push the vehicles away from the fire,” said the security officers, who had also notified the Alfred Duma Municipal fire department. Other residents had desperately tried to fight the fire by dousing the engulfed house with buckets of water and garden hoses. “It happened so quickly and before we knew it the whole house was on fire,” said an onlooker. While firefighters had brought the house fire under control and from spreading to other homes and their vehicles, another emergency call came in notifying firefighters that a fire had broken out at Bawas Furniture factory store. Firefighters, after spending almost two hours at the house, rushed to the factory. The blaze had completely engulfed the factory shop. Firefighters worked to ensure that the fire did not spread to the rest of the factories alongside Bawas.  Firefighters managed to control the fire, but the whole factory was destroyed in the blaze. Ladysmith police told the Ladysmith Herald that an arson case has been opened for the Bawas Factory store, but further investigation needs to be done at the house fire in Spinner Road.
