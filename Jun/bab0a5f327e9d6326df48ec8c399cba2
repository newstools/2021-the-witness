The SAPS’ drug and firearm unit seized drugs to the value of R108 million when they pulled over a car travelling to Pongola on the N2 at 7 am on Thursday. Captain Nqobile Gwala said that when the officers searched the vehicle, they found 6kg of raw packed heroin, hidden inside plastic coffee packets. Gwala said the unit had received credible information that drugs were going to be transported and that the 28-year-old driver was driving from Durban to Johannesburg when he was caught. “The team worked tirelessly ... trying to gather all the information regarding the suspect,” she added. “The police officers mobilised en route towards Jozini and Pongola, after holding intense observation during the course of the night.” The driver was arrested on charges of dealing and possession of drugs. He is expected to appear before the Pongola Magistrates’ Court on June 7.
