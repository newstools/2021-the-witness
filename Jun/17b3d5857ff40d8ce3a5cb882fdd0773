Police say all is in order as burial proceedings go ahead for the slain gang leader, Sphelele Ntsuntsu Mkhize at KwaCaluza, in Pietermaritzburg, on Saturday. Spokesperson for the Plessislaer Police Station, Sfiso Gwala told The Witness there was no sign of any criminal activity and that all was in order. “There are no incidents to report and the body has been moved to the deceased's house,” said Gwala. Mkhize and six others died in a shoot-out with the police on Fairfield Avenue, in Pietermaritzburg's Scottsville suburb last week. The other six people were; Portia Phakathi (19) from Panorama, Amahle Ngcobo (18), Manelisi Ndlovu (25) from Westgate, Bheki Mazibuko from France Township as well as Andile Mdunge (17) and Mthokozisi Ngubane from Imbali. Seven firearms were found, an AK 47, a rifle, a shotgun and four pistols. Three vehicles were in the yard, two of which were hijacked. They claim the taxi boss, Mazibuko, had taken food to his cousin, Mkhize, when the police stormed the Scottsville home where the gang boss was hiding following his daring escape from a truck transporting prisoners to court.
