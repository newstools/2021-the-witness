The names of the seven people who died in a shoot-out between the police and an alleged gang in Pietermaritzburg's Fairfield Avenue, in Scottsville, last week, were finally released on Wednesday morning. Five men and two women were killed but none of the police officers were injured or killed. They are; Portia Phakathi (19) from Panorama, Amahle Ngcobo (18), Manelisi Ndlovu (25) from Westgate, Bheki Mazibuko (Shange) from France Township, Sphelele Mkhize (35) from Snathing as well as Andile Mdunge (17) and Mthokozisi Ngubane from Imbali. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said she did not have any more information regarding the dead. Mkhize is said to be the gang leader. He and Mazibuko were both reportedly buried at the weekend during heavily guarded funeral services. The five men were alleged to be part of the gang that had been terrorising residents of Pietermaritzburg and surrounding areas. On Sunday, the police tracked down their alleged accomplices to a lodge on Scottsville’s Woodhouse Road, not far from where seven others were killed during last week’s shoot-out. The group is linked to a string of murder cases that were committed in the Pietermaritzburg, Imbali, Richmond and Bergville.
