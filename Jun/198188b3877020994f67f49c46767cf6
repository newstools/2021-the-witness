President Cyril Ramaphosa will address the nation on Tuesday night, June 15, at 8 pm on developments in the country’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Ramaphosa’s Tuesday hectic schedule which included a meeting with the Premiers of the nine provinces has raised speculations that he is on the verge of announcing stricter Covid-19 restrictions. Ramaphosa, who earlier on Tuesday chaired a National Coronavirus Command Council meeting, is also chaired a cabinet meeting. The President's address to the nation happens as Covid-19 infections were on the rise, with the country recording an average of 5000 daily infections in recent days. The country is currently on level 2 lockdown restrictions. However, experts were of the view that the current high infection rate, coupled by the country’s slow Covid-19 vaccination process, required the President to introduce stricter Covid-19 restrictions
