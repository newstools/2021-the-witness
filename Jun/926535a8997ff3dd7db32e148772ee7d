Two people were killed and seven others injured in a horrific accident at the Brickfield Road off-ramp from the N3 in Durban just after 7 pm on Monday. In a statement, KZN VIP Medical said its paramedics were met by "total carnage" when they arrived at the crash site. The driver of a light delivery vehicle, which was loaded with passengers, reportedly lost control on the freeway, overturning multiple times and ejecting most of the passengers. The driver, a man in his 30s, sustained fatal injuries, as did one of the passengers, a woman in her 20s. Both were declared dead at the scene. Seven other people were critically injured in the crash. After being stabilised at the crash site, by multiple advanced life support paramedics, they were rushed to a nearby Durban hospital for the further treatment. The cause of the accident isn't known, but the SAPS are investigating.
