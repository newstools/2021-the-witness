Two people and their pet dog were killed on Wednesday in a head-on crash between their SUV and a truck transporting horses in KwaZulu-Natal. Derrick Banks, from Meditech Emergency Response, said the accident happened at around 5 pm near the corners of Kassier Road and Mr559 Rtr when travelling towards Shongweni Dam, in the Outer West Region. Banks said when paramedics arrived on the scene they found that an SUV and truck, carrying horses, collided head-on. He said the two people who were in the SUV, and their pet dog, all died at the scene. Banks said the two people who were travelling in the truck suffered moderate injuries and were taken to hospital. All the horses were found to have escaped without any injuries. Banks said Meditech ER Paramedics, together with Metro Police, assisted the Ethekwini Fire Department to free the two people and their dog who were stuck in the wrecked SUV. He said jaws of life were used. The exact events leading up to the accident will be investigated by local authorities, said Banks.
