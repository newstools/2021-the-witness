Ahead of the matric rewrite period, the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) said on Tuesday that they are not affiliated to, nor do they endorse ‘matric upgrade centres’ or ‘schools’ UKZN’s acting executive director of Corporate Relations, Normah Zondo, said in a statement: “It has again been brought to our attention that operators are representing, on various social media platforms, that the university is linked to their centre(s) or school(s). This is not only false, but also misleading as UKZN has no association with any of these centres or schools.” Zondo said that the university has been receiving many queries about these establishments and would like to categorically distance UKZN from any and all such entities. “We call on all 2020 grade 12 pupils, their parents, and guardians to be cautious about such entities. None of these entities, can or may, offer services to secure and/or assist with admission or residence accommodation at UKZN, nor guarantee the same. Any money paid over to such entitles (or to private individuals purportedly representing these entities) offering such services, will be lost, and the university cannot accept any responsibility for this,” added Zondo. Zondo urged the public to report these entities that falsely link themselves to the university to the police, “This conduct is a crime and criminal prosecution must follow,” said Zondo. Concerned members of the public can call the UKZN Fraud Hotline toll-free number on 0800 203 285 or e-mail: ukzn@tip-offs.com. The university will take firm legal action against these unlawful entities. Applying to the university for the 2022 academic year can be done through the central application office on www.cao.ac.za. Limited spaces for certain programmes may be available for the second semester of 2021. This will be advertised, and applications will need to be done through the office.
