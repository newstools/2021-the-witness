The Sharks have confirmed new additions to their coaching staff as the Durban-based franchise prepares to navigate the unchartered waters in the form of United Rugby Championship (URC). The franchise also confirmed that it has parted ways with assistant coach Brent Janse van Rensburg. According to the Sharks, Janse van Rensburg has requested an early exit from his contract due to family reasons. URC, which will pit four South African premier rugby franchises against PRO14 European sides, is set to start in September this year. Sharks have bolstered their technical team by adding the highly-rated Irish-born Noel McNamara, the experienced John McFarland and Springbok Sevens head coach Neil Powell. However, Powell will only join them next year, after the Sevens World Cup. McNamara comes in as attack coach while former Boks defence coach McFarland will head up defence, until the arrival of Powell. The new men will all serve under head coach Sean Everitt. “We are pleased to have secured the expertise of these experienced coaches who not only have great coaching pedigrees, but are good people, who will fit seamlessly into our culture here at the Cell C Sharks,” said Sharks chief executive Eduard Coetzee.
