A woman (63) died while waiting in the queue for the Covid-19 vaccine in Tongaat on Tuesday afternoon. According to Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) spokesperson Prem Balram, the family of the woman contacted them for assistance at the vaccine roll-out centre. RUSA medics were dispatched to the scene and on arrival found the woman in the back seat of a car. She was pronounced dead on being assessed. The family of the woman told RUSA that she did not receive her vaccination before she died. Balram said that according to medical staff at the vaccination centre, the woman went into respiratory distress before receiving her vaccination. Doctors attempted to stabilise the woman, however her condition deteriorated rapidly. “Her family then opted to transport her to a medical facility and she was loaded into a car. They then contacted the RUSA operations center for assistance when they realised that she became unresponsive,” said Balram.
