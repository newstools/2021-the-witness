serial rapist, Calvin Thabede (32), was sentenced to eight life terms by
the Madadeni Magistrate's Court on Friday. He
was also given an additional 36 years of imprisonment for rape and other petty
crimes. The
Democratic Alliance Women’s Network (DAWN) in KwaZulu-Natal said Thabede was
charged for the rape of eight women, including a 67-year-old woman. Shehana
Kajee, KZN’s DAWN leader, welcomed the sentence. He had been terrorising women
since 2010, she said. Kajee
added that the prolonged process to hand down judgments has become a norm in
the justice system and government is doing little to nothing to address this. Kajee
said it has been revealed that KZN currently has a staggering 8 388 DNA
forensic case backlog, dating back as far as February 2020. A total of 5 400 of
the cases relate to sexual assault. “DNA
testing forms a huge part in cases of sexual assault and rape and with the
backlog at testing laboratories such cases are then prolonged. Victims have to
then relive their trauma and live in fear until there is sufficient evidence
from these laboratories to jail the perpetrators. “The
prolonged processes make it easy for perpetrators to continue terrorising the
vulnerable. They are not scared of the law knowing that they will not be
jailed. As a result, women and children continue to suffer,” said Kajee. She
said this past week brutal crimes against women have proven why we are dubbed
the “rape capital” of the country. She
said a 66-year-old woman was allegedly raped and brutally killed by her
grandson on Thursday in uMlazi. A
21-year-old woman from Mzimkhulu was allegedly brutally murdered by her
26-year-old boyfriend. She had reportedly opened multiple cases of abuse
against the boyfriend but later dropped the charges. A
38-year-old woman from Port Shepstone was allegedly shot and killed by her
police officer boyfriend. “Until
there is serious intervention from government, women and children will continue
living in fear,” said Kajee.
