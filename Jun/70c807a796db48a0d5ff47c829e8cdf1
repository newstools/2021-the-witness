Despite the 15-month sentence handed by the ConCourt on Tuesday, former president Jacob Zuma remains unshaken, with her daughter, Dudu Zuma-Sambudla, saying he was in “high spirits”. The Constitutional Court on Tuesday ordered Zuma to hand himself to the police so that he could resume the 15-month sentence which the ConCourt imposed on him for defying the highest court’s order to appear before the Zondo Commission of Inquiry. However, in a tweet posted on Tuesday afternoon, the former president’s daughter said Zuma (79) was not scared to go to prison. “@PresJGZuma is in high spirits and has no fear. We have a choice between serving our time in Jhb or Nkandla, …of course we have chosen to be close to home. Lockdown or no lockdown, we will escort you to serve your time,” she said. In its judgment, the ConCourt ordered police minister, Bheki Cele, to ensure that Zuma was arrested within three days should the former president fail to abide by the order to hand himself to police within five days.
