Rates assessments will not be issued for two weeks from July 1, because Msunduzi Municipality is updating its tariff increases. Chief executive of the Pietermaritzburg & Midlands Chamber of Business Melanie Veness said in a message to their members that the municipality will be entering into its new financial year and with this comes the annual increase in rates randages and service tariffs. These randages and service tariffs will have to be uploaded onto the SAP financial system and thoroughly tested and audited, she said.
