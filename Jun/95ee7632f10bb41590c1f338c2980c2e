The South African Weather Service (Saws) has warned of extremely high fire danger conditions expected over the western and central parts of KwaZulu-Natal. The weather service said strong, dry, and hot north-westerly winds are expected over KZN’s interior. “These weather conditions are conducive for the development and spread of veld fires. NW 20-25KT winds with minimum relative humidity less than 20% expected over western and central interior of KZN,” said Saws. The areas expected to be affected include Abaqulusi, Alfred Duma - Indaka, Alfred Duma - Ladysmith, Dannhauser, Dr N. Dlamini-Zuma - Underberg, eDumbe, eMadlangeni, Endumeni, Greater Kokstad, Impendle, Ingwe, Inkosi Langalibalele - Escourt, Inkosi Langalibalele - Sobabili, Mpofana - Giants Castle, Mpofana - Mooi River, Msinga, Mthonjaneni, Newcastle, Nkandla, Nongoma, Nquthu, Okhahlamba, Ulundi, uMngeni, Umvoti, Umzimkhulu and uPhongolo. Saws warned that the extremely high fire danger conditions are favourable for the development and spread of fire which may result in damage to property and loss of human and animal life. People are urged not to make fires in the open and leave fires unattended, not to throw cigarette butts out of cars or in the open veldt and not to throw bottles in the veldt as they can magnify the sun’s rays and start fires. In the case of a large fire, people should report it immediately and move away from the area to let the professionals deal with it. Never throw water onto a fire started by an electrical fault or fires started by oil or paraffin lamps. In this case sand or a blanket should be used to smother the fire.
