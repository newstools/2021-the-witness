The Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation, Blade Nzimande, has reassured students that their NSFAS funding will not be affected when they change their course or their learning institution. In terms of the criteria, the Higher Education Department said in a statement that its continued funding of NSFAS beneficiaries is based on academic eligibility testing which includes the N+ rule. N is the minimum qualification completion time, also known as regulation time, specified by the institution for a programme of study funded by NSFAS. N+1 applies to first-time entering students who registered after December 2017, while N+2 applies to students who first registered before January 2018. “If a student is transferred from any other public university, regardless of whether they were funded at that university, the number of years already registered for the qualification will be counted as part of the minimum qualification completion time,” said Nzimande. He added said that NSFAS does not stop funding because students change institutions. “Students contravene the rules when they no longer meet academic eligibility requirements, exceed their N+ time, and move between institutions without declaring their movement,” he said.
