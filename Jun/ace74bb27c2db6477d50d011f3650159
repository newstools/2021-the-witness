Motorists are being advised to avoid Ohrtmann Road, Pietermaritzburg, where Jika Joe residents are protesting over a lack of service delivery. Burning tyres and other debris are obstructing the entire traffic light intersection on the bridge. Drivers using the off-ramp from the N3 north-bound have been caught up in the traffic chaos. Traffic is backed up on the N3 north-bound due to the offramp being closed. Ward councillor Suraya Reddy said she believed the protests were in response to electricity disconnections in the Jik Joe informal settlement. The Witness has previously reported that a transformer serving the area was being overloaded by illegal disconnections, leaving paying customers without lights for days on end. Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson, Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese, said police were on site.
