They were arrested during a police operation conducted at Ntuzuma Township on Tuesday morning. KZN police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said the police were at Ntuzuma when they spotted a car with five men driving recklessly along Mgwenya Road. “The (car) was intercepted, however four men jumped out of the vehicle and disappeared into an informal settlement. Police were able to arrest the driver as he attempted to flee. He was searched and was found with a car key in his pocket. “The suspect’s car was also searched and police found a toy gun and housebreaking implements in the boot of the car. A preliminary investigation conducted at the scene revealed that the car was hijacked at Phoenix during May 2021,” said Gwala. The man was placed under arrest for being in possession of a stolen car and housebreaking implements. The second man (30) was arrested in the Soweto area of Ntuzuma for being in possession of a stolen car. The car was hijacked at Newlands in May.
