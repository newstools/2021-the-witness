The Pietermaritzburg High Court on Monday convicted and sentenced Nonkululeko Ngwabe (46) to 22 years' imprisonment for killing her police husband, Warrant Officer Thulani Ngwabe (51). Hawks spokesperson, Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo, said Ngwabe’s lifeless body was found on November 3,  2019, on the railway lines near Port Shepstone beach with multiple stab wounds. He  had been stationed at the Margate Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit. A case of murder was reported to the Port Shepstone Police Station and the case docket was allocated to Hawks members from the Port Shepstone Serious Organised Crime Unit for investigation. Mhlongo said the Hawks left no stone unturned in their investigation. The wife was arrested in December 2019. “Her apprehension led to the information about her accomplices she allegedly hired to kill her husband. Members worked tirelessly until the three accused, Sthembiso Mbona (25), Nhlakanipho Ndovela (23) and Saziso Khambule (25) were brought to book.” They all appeared in the Port Shepstone Magistrate’s Court several times and were remanded in custody until the case was transferred to the Pietermaritzburg High Court for trial. The case of the three men has been adjourned to June 18.
