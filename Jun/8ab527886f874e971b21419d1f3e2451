Eskom will be implementing stage 2 load shedding from 10 am on Wednesday morning until Sunday night. In a statement released on Wednesday morning, Eskom said that the rolling power cuts were due to delays in returning generation units to service at Kusile, Tutuka, Duvha, Kendal and Koeberg power stations. Eskom has apologised for the inconvenience and uncertainty caused by the power cuts and asked South Africans to cut down consumption of electricity. The power utility said it is necessary to implement load shedding continuously during this period in order to replenish the emergency reserves. Eskom will communicate promptly should there be any changes. Breakdowns currently total 13,752MW of capacity while planned maintenance is 1,200MW.
