A truck accident that happened on Wednesday night on the N3 near the Ashburton offramp is causing major traffic jams as the freeway is still blocked on Thursday morning. There are reports that some motorists spent the night stuck in traffic, in very cold conditions. Road Traffic Inspectorate spokesperson, Zinhle Mali, told The Witness that a tanker travelling from Durban towards Pietermaritzburg crashed into another truck near the Ashburton offramp. She said one person was badly injured and another died at the scene. "The tanker truck landed on the other lane, heading towards Durban and caused a major traffic backlog on the freeway. We are also getting information that there are people who slept in their cars on the freeway," said Mali. Craig Botha, from Kwazulu Private Ambulance, said three people suffered minor injuries and one person was killed. Mali said the truck was still blocking the freeway but said emergency services were busy trying to recover it. Motorists have been urged to use alternative routes as there is major traffic on the N3 when travelling from Pietermaritzburg to Durban on Thursday morning. The traffic backlog has affected traffic in the Willowton, Mountain Rise and Northdale areas in Pietermaritzburg. Motorists are advised to use the R103, M13 and M7 but to also expect delays on those routes.
