Residents from KwaNzimakwe blockaded the N2 freeway near Port Edward at 4 am on Thursday demanding better roads. Taxi drivers in the area said they planned the peaceful protest to divert traffic into the KwaNzimakwe area in an attempt to show roadusers the state of roads in the area. Taxis blocked the R61 and N2 as well as the route from the Mpenjathi bridge to Ithongazi. KZN SAPS spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said the road is still closed due to 40 residents who blockaded the road with burning tyres. “The police are at the scene to monitor and stabilise the situation,” she said. The Post Office in Port Edward told The Witness that the strike has affected payments for the day. “A vehicle which was on the way to our Post Office was turned away so we cannot do payments today. If the strike continues tomorrow, payments will be affected again. It’s best that people call before trying to come in.”
