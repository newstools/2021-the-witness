The KwaZulu-Natal provincial cabinet has finally approved the contentious scholar Transport Policy which has been the source of a prolonged dispute between the government and NGOs. According to a statement released on Thursday following a provincial cabinet meeting, the policy will ensure that the province’s pupils, including those with special needs, were catered for. “The policy also provides clarity by providing for justification should learners or their parents choose to attend a school that is further from home when a school already exists in their neighbourhood,” the provincial cabinet said. In 2019, NGO Equal Education (EE) obtained a court order compelling the provincial government to release the policy for public comment. When the provincial government eventually released the policy for public comment, EE, which held a picket outside the provincial education department’s Pietermaritzburg offices in April, pointed out a number of flaws in the document. “It was the wrong policy … It also didn’t state how scholar transport will be funded,” EE said at the time. However, the provincial cabinet said the new policy addressed a number of issues which have not been sufficiently dealt with in the earlier version of the policy. “The policy also provides clarity by providing for justification should learners or their parents choose to attend a school that is further from home when a school already exists in their neighbourhood,” the provincial cabinet said.
