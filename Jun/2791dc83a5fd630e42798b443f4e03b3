Two people were killed, and many were left injured after a crash involving numerous vehicles on the N2 southbound carriageway near a cement factory on Friday afternoon. Emer-G-Med said reports from the scene indicate that a light delivery vehicle careened across the centre median, before colliding with a truck. Multiple secondary collisions then occurred with as many as five motor vehicles colliding with the accident scene. The N2 remained closed to traffic from the M7 off-ramp to allow emergency services to clear the scene. Emer-G-Med said that police also attended the scene and are investigating what happened.
