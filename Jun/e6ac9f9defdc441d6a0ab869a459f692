The Department of Rural Development has undertaken to comply with Friday's court judgment which found that rental agreements which the Ingonyama Trust Board (ITB) imposed on rural dwellers were unlawful. The Pietermaritzburg High Court found the ITB's decision to convert Kwazulu-Natal rural dwellers’ Permission to Occupy (PTO) certificates into rental leases was illegal. In a statement issued on Monday, Rural Development Minister Thoko Didiza said she will see to it that the court order was fully implemented. "We will ask the Ingonyama Trust Board to stop the conversion process and return the money it has charged those individuals," she said. The judgment came after seven rural women challenged ITB's decision to make rural dwellers pay rent for land they were occupied. Didiza said the department would also comply with the court order compelling it to develop the necessary capacity to manage rural land.
