Xolani Ntuli (24) was given two life sentences for raping two girls, aged 10 and 12, in Empangeni in 2018. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said in 2018 the two girls from Ezikhaleni Reserve, in Empangeni, were attending a virginity testing in the area when the woman who was conducting the test realised that they had been sexually assaulted. Gwala said the woman informed their parents and the girls were questioned. “They revealed to their parents that they were raped by Xolani Ntuli (24) who threatened to harm them should they tell anyone,” said Gwala. She said the incidents happened on different occasions at Ezikhaleni Reserve. The first incident took place on March 15, 2018, when the 10-year-old girl was raped by Ntuli while visiting her friend, said Gwala. She said the second incident took place on September 11, 2018, when the 12-year-old girl was asleep and was also raped by Ntuli. The matter was reported to the Empangeni police station, and the docket of rape was transferred to Empangeni Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for further investigation. Gwala said Ntuli left the area when he heard that the girls decided to break their silence. “An intensive investigation led to the arrest of Ntuli on September 18, 2019, at Inanda where he was hiding." Ntuli made his first court appearance at the Empangeni Magistrates’ Court on September 20, 2019. His bail was denied, and he was kept behind the bars until the matter was finalised at Empangeni Regional Court. On May 25 this year, the court found him guilty and he was sentenced to two life imprisonment for two counts of rape.
