The son-in-law and grandson of suspected drug kingpin, Yaganathan “Teddy Mafia” Pillay, who was shot dead at his home, have been charged with attempted murder. Kesavan Isaac Naidoo (41) and Carlton Naidoo (19) appeared briefly in the Durban Magistrate’s Court recently. They are also charged with pointing a firearm and theft. The father and son have been remanded in custody until July 2. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said they also allegedly stole the magazine and ammunition of the man who they had assaulted. The incident took place on June 7, in Chatsworth. Kesavan is married to Pillay’s daughter Jolene Naidoo and Carlton is their son. The death of Pillay in January made national news when he was shot and killed in Chatsworth. His suspected killers were caught by the community and beheaded on the streets, with their bodies burnt beyond recognition. Pillay’s death subsequently started a gang war in Chatsworth where there have been numerous incidents of killings and attempted murders.
