A truck driver and a suspected truck surfer were killed when a truck rear-ended another truck on the N3 at Van Reenen's Pass late on Wednesday night. Truck surfing is an act where pedestrians climb onto the back of big trucks and hitch rides without the driver of the truck knowing. Emer-G-Med said when paramedics arrived at the scene around 10 pm, they found that two trucks had collided. â€œOne of the vehicles rear-ended the other, causing the driver to lose control of his vehicle which careened off the roadway, smashing into the barrier." The driver, and only occupant of the vehicle, were declared dead on the scene. On further inspection, Emer-G-Med said another man was found pinned between the two wreckages. Emer-G-Med said reports from the scene suggested that the man could have been truck surfing at the time of the accident. The roadway remained closed for several hours to allow for emergency services to clear the scene and the police to conduct the necessary investigations, said Emer-G-Med.
