Ladysmith police arrested about 29 people outside a local
shisa’nyama, along Kandahar Ave, on Friday night for not adhering to Covid-19
regulations. The operations, led by Brigadier Francis Bantham, was
targeting those not adhering to Covid 19 regulations. The 29 people, including 16-and 17-year-olds, were arrested
after police found them drinking alcohol and dancing in the streets at around
10.30 pm on Friday night. They were also not wearing masks. The partygoers were seen trying to plead with police and a
few asked the police why they were being arrested because they were not doing
anything wrong.  Police were also looking
for the owner of the establishment but could not find him. “We are not doing anything wrong, so why are we being
arrested like criminals,” said one of the people. Brigadier Bantham warned the public that police would not
hesitate to arrest those who fail to comply with Covid-19 regulations. “You have been told by the president to stay at home or be
at home by 10, but you are not listening,” said the Brigadier. Last week South Africa tightened coronavirus restrictions,
extending the curfew, and limiting alcohol sales in the face of a surge in
infections over the past weeks. The curfew was extended by an hour, running from 10 pm to 4
am, while restaurants and bars have been ordered to close early to allow their
employees to travel home before the curfew kicks in.
