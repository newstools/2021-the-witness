The Sharks on Tuesday confirmed the capture of Springbok hooker Bongi Mbonambi from Western Province. The Durban rugby outfit were recently rumoured to be chasing Mbonambi’s signature and they announced the successful move on social media. This is their second major signing from Western Province in recent months after Siya Kolisi joined them to map a new personal future. The 30-year-old Mbonambi has 36 Test caps to his name and leaves Cape Town after six years of service to Province. The Sharks are currently preparing to face the Bulls in the Rainbow Cup SA’s last round in Durban on Saturday, but it is understood that Mbonambi will come to Durban after the British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa. Said the Sharks on Twitter: “The Sharks have completed the signing of Springbok hooker Bongi Mbonambi from the Stormers. He will join the squad later this year.”
