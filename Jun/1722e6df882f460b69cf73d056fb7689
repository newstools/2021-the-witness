Fans of Babes Wodumo and Mampintsha can now watch a trailer for Uthando Lodumo, which follows the gqom superstars in the build-up to their traditional wedding. “We’re an open book in the way we live our lives,” says Babes, whose real name Bongekile Simelane, in the Showmax original reality series. The series follows her and the West Ink Records founder from his proposal, live on air on Gagasi FM in October 2020, through marriage counselling, lobola negotiations and pregnancy all the way to their wedding in April 2021. The couple have a lot to celebrate following the birth of their first child this week. They shared snaps with their bundle of joy on Instagram where they were showered with congratulations from fans and local celebrities alike.  Babes burst onto the gqom scene in 2016 with a hit single Wololo, featuring Mampintsha, real name Mandla Maphumulo, and Distruction Boyz, which racked up over 11 million views on YouTube alone. It was also nominated as Record of the Year at the MTV Africa Music Awards and the South African Music Awards. As Babes says in the trailer, “We were madly in love. We then made hit song after hit song. And we made a lot of money as a result.” But their relationship hasn’t always been a fairytale, with an incident of gender-based violence trending on social media in 2019. The trailer suggests Mampintsha is still dealing with the aftermath of that controversy, as his initial letter to Babes’ family is rejected. Viewers will also see him apologising to Babes’ parents and Babes worrying about whether her family will turn Mampintsha’s family away at the gate. Uthando Lodumo is being produced and directed by South African Film and Television Award (SAFTA) winner, Thomas Gumede, and SAFTA nominee, Lungile Radu ,through their production company, Parental Advisory. All three episodes of the Showmax Original will be available to binge on June 30. Watch the trailer here:
