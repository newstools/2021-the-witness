Sacca informal settlement residents continued with their protest action from Wednesday by burning tyres and barricading the Shortts Retreat Road in Mkondeni on Thursday morning. The shack dwellers said they were protesting on behalf of Truda Snacks workers as well as those left unemployed. They moved trashed cans, which they took from business premises in the area, and left them in the middle of the street causing major traffic issues in Mkondeni. Employees from Bakers had their hands full trying to move the bins from the road in attempt to ease the traffic congestion. Police on the scene said they had managed to damped down the protest action from earlier in the morning while the Msunduzi fire and rescue team continued to put out random fires started by protesters along Shortts Retreat Road.
