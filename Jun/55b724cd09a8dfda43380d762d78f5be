The KwaZulu-Natal Social Development Department has called on police to urgently track down a man who locked his girlfriend in a shack and set it alight in Ixopo, southern KwaZulu-Natal. In a statement released on Monday, the department said that on Wednesday last week, a man set alight his shack with his girlfriend inside, following an altercation. The incident took place at the Fairview Informal settlement. “The woman was rescued by neighbours who heard her cries in the burning shack. She was rushed to hospital with serious burn injuries on her body.  All attempts by medical practitioners to save the her life failed and she succumbed to her injuries,” said the department. Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza, called on the public to work with police to bring the man to justice. “We know the pain the family is going through right now. We wish them strength during this difficult time. Our police have to work day and night to ensure that the alleged perpetrator involved in this horrible murder is found so that he can face the law. He killed a human being in such a horrible manner and he should never be let off the hook,” she said. Khoza said the incident has brought the country and the province’s serious problem of gender-based violence into the spotlight. “Our communities should work with the department to isolate all those involved in GBV. We cannot sit on our laurels while women and children suffer in the hands of criminals who once claimed they loved them,” she said. “Currently, we are responding to many cases of women and children murders in the province. This indicates that our people have lost ubuntu.  The other incident that happened in KwaNongoma where a pensioner and her grandchild were stabbed to death by criminals who wanted to rob them of grant money is very concerning,” she said.
