A new three-way stop will be implemented this month at the Howick North/Tweedie interchange (N3/R107 intersection) which will help improve traffic flow. The N3 Toll Concession said in a statement that the three-way stop is to improve traffic flow, particularly during peak traffic hours. It will not impact traffic on the N3 toll road, but will improve traffic flow at the intersections. “Implementing a three-way stop, where a key transport node crosses over a busy highway and traffic volumes are high, is expected to go a long way to control traffic, reduce congestion and decrease driver frustration. “Road users are advised to be extra vigilant when approaching the intersections, to reduce speed and anticipate and obey all traffic signs, including the new three-way stop,” said the statement.
