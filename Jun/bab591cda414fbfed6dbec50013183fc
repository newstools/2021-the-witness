Durban residents are going to be hit with a new water levy plus a hike on their water and electricity tariffs on July 1. As the new financial year begins, the eThekwini Municipality council will be introducing a new water and sanitation infrastructure levy. The levy will charge residents an additional R1.50/Kl for water and R1.50/Kl for sewerage disposal for the next three years. According to a statement released by the municipality, the money from the new levy will contributed towards the R1 billion needed to fund the upgrading of the City’s ageing water and sanitation infrastructure. “The municipality has experienced an increased number of faults at pump stations and treatment works which has impacted negatively on the delivery of basic water services. “These faults are due to ageing infrastructure but can also be attributed to external factors including vandalism, load shedding, and the population expansion in the municipality,” read the statement. EThekwini said the implementation of the levy will ensure continued operations and maintenance with increased reliability of the water supply. “It will further ensure both financial viability and infrastructure sustainability to continue with uncompromised water and sanitation service delivery,” the municipality added.. The levy will be in addition to the recently passed tariff hikes on electricity (14.9%) and water and sanitation (8.5%).
