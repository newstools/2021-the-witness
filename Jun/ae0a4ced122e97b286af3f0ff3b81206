The decomposed body of a small child has been found in a septic tank in the Entabeni area of Dambuza, Pietermaritzburg. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Thembeka Mbele said that late on Sunday night the Pietermaritzburg Search and Rescue and Pietermaritzburg K9 Search and Rescue units were called to help Plessislaer police with a confined space body recovery. Members of the community had discovered the four-year-old child's body. The police recovered the body from the septic tank, and it was handed over to the Plessislaer police. The child was identified as Mlando Zuma who went missing on June 18. Mbele said on Monday, community members gathered outside the house where the child was found and set the house alight. "We are appealing to community not to take law into their own hands, the acts of vigilantism will not be tolerated in our province. We are still waiting for the post-mortem results that will determine the cause of death," said Mbele.
