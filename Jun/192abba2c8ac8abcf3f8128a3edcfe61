Manor flats residents took to the streets early on Thursday morning to protest against municipal evictions. They started fires and created a blockade with rocks and tree branches on Ohrtmann Road, near the bridge, after telling The Witness on Wednesday they would shut down Pietermaritzburg if the evictions continued. Motorists have been advised to steer clear of Orthmann Road on their way to work, to avoid traffic build up. Msunduzi Municipality’s spokesperson, Thobeka Mafumbatha, said on Wednesday that evictions would go ahead as planned. “We have secured four evictions to date and these will be implemented,” she added.
