A 53-year-old teacher is expected to appear in the Madadeni Magistratesâ€™ Court on Friday for allegedly raping a pupil in the school toilets. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said it is alleged that on June 9, an 11-year-old girl was at a school in Madadeni when she was raped by one of the teachers in the school toilets. She was threatened to be killed if she reported the matter to anyone. Gwala said the girl told her mother what happened, and a case of rape was opened at the Madadeni SAPS. The docket was transferred to the Newcastle Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit (FCS) for further investigation. Gwala said the teacher was arrested on Thursday morning by the unit.
