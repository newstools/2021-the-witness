Two private security guards have now been dismissed after they were caught on video assaulting an elderly patient at Estcourt Hospital in KwaZulu-Natal. Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane has condemned the incident, and also expressed her disquiet that the video appears to have been filmed by a hospital staff member, who failed to intervene during the assault, or report the matter to hospital management until it was brought to her attention by a journalist. “It is extremely concerning that, instead of making management aware, they decided to send out the video. “If they had followed processes, you’ll find that the patient might not have been assaulted as severely as they were. We hear that it might have been one of our health workers who took this video. If it is, then it is very unfortunate,” she said. Simelane said the department is investigating the matter and management has been instructed to deal with it decisively. “While they are investigating, we’ve also said the private company that is responsible for the security personnel who were assaulting the patient must suspend those people with immediate effect. We will then get a proper report tomorrow on what’ been done,” said Simelane. It was later revealed that the two private security guards implicated in the video have been dismissed by their employer. The nurse who is believed to have filmed the incident, but did nothing else, has been placed on precautionary suspension, pending finalisation of the investigation, said the department.
