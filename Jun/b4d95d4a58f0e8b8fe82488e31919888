A 43-year-old man was badly injured after he impaled himself while attempting to climb over a palisade fence in Durban North on Monday morning. Shawn Herbst, Netcare 911’s spokesperson, said the incident happened shortly after 2 am. He said when medics arrived at the scene, they found the man hanging upside down with the spikes deeply embedded in his lower limbs. “In order to free the man, a portion of the fence had to be cut away by a Netcare 911 rescue technician with the assistance of the Ethekwini Fire and Rescue Services,” said Herbst. Herbst said the man had suffered traumatic injuries and he was taken to hospital.
