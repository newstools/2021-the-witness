The department said the smoke was experienced at the A-block at the iNkosi Mhlabunzima Maphumulo House, which is the head office of the department. Its spokesperson, Kwanele Ncalane, said the smoke was detected early and attended to, with staff members safely evacuated. He said currently, the department has commissioned an investigation into the cause of the smoke and once finalised it will engage with the public works department, who manage the building. Ncalane said the A-block houses critical units including human resources, information technology, supply chain management, legal services, office services and finance. “No documents were destroyed or affected after the smoke was detected and no staff members were harmed or injured during the evacuation process.
