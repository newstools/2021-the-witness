This year’s Hill’s 1000 Paws Walk for SPCAs has a new venue: the Highgate Wine Estate on the R103 in Lions River. Taking place on June 20, from 8 am to 2 pm, the event aims to raise much needed funds for the Pietermaritzburg, uMngeni and Mooi River SPCAs. Strict Covid-19 protocols will be in place, with numbers limited and sanitiser and cleaning crews on hand throughout the walk. The entry fees remain the same as for the 2019 Hill’s 1000 Paws Walk: R40 for adults, R10 per dog and children under 12 enter for free. “Please come along and help raise much-needed funds for the three Midlands’ SPCAs,” said spokesperson Gaynor Lawson. “Don’t forget it’s Father’s Day, so take dad a mug of hot coffee in bed before you all head out!” For more information, phone Gaynor on 082 558 8928 or e-mail glawson@global.co.za.
