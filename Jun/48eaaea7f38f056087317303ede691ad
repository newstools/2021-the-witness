Ahead of their all-important Rainbow Cup clash against the Lions this weekend, Sharks coach Sean Everitt on Thursday made numerous changes to his Matchday 23 with a host of Springboks rested. The Durban outfit visit the Lions for a must-win match at Ellis Park in Johannesburg at 4 pm on Saturday. Boks such as Lukhanyo Am, Siya Kolisi, S’bu Nkosi (injured), talented fullback Aphelele Fassi and star flyhalf Curwin Bosch are not in the team, but try-scoring machine Makazole Mapimpi is set to make his first appearance in the competition after his stint in Japan. A defeat for Everitt’s men will mean a serious dent to their ambitions of featuring in the much-anticipated North-vs-South Rainbow Cup final between the winners of the South African and European sections of the competition. The Sharks also need to bounce back from their two defeats in the row which saw them drop from the top spot to third place on the log table. Everitt named an all-new front row with Ntuthuko Mchunu, Kerron van Vuuren and Wiehahn Herbst taking over from Ox Nche, Fez Mbatha and Thomas du Toit, who all have been shifted to the bench. Hyron Andrews is back in the starting XV as he replaces experienced lock Reniel Hugo in the second row. Fetcher James Venter also makes a return in place of Kolisi after a long-term injury. Phepsi Buthelezi will play at eighthman, with Thembelani Bholi named on the bench and Henco Venter taking over the captaincy from Am and shifting back to flank. Manie Libbok will start at flyhalf and Werner Kok replaces Am at centre. Anthony Volmink will play at fullback.
