Narandas Jewellers at the Gateway Mall in Durban was robbed again on Sunday. This is the second time the store has been robbed in under a year. Police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said police are investigating a case of business robbery. She said that just before 1 pm, a group of unknown suspects entered the jewellery store in Umhlanga and held up the employees and the security guard. They took jewellery and fled the scene in their getaway vehicle. No shots were fired, she added. Gateway Mall said in a statement that no customers or employees of the store were hurt during the armed robbery. “The tenants Smoke Cloak was immediately activated, forcing the suspects to leave the mall shortly after- with an undisclosed amount of merchandise,” said the mall. The Narandas Jewellers jewellery shop at the Pavilion Mall in Durban was robbed earlier this year in April. During that incident two shoppers were injured during a cross fire between the robbers and security guards. In November last year, also on a Sunday, eight armed men stormed Narandas in Gateway Mall and made off with a substantial amount of jewellery. The brazen attack was captured on CCTV cameras.
