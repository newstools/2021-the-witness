A 45-year-old man was left in a serious condition after being stabbed while he was walking home from work on Thursday in Durban North. According to Netcare 911’s Shawn Herbst, the man was on the Old North Coast Road in Glen Ashley when he was approached by four men. Witnesses said the man was stabbed in the thigh after a struggle broke out between him and his alleged attackers. “When medics arrived on scene they found the patient unconscious, beaten up, lying in a pool of blood,” Herbst said. “The patient was assessed on scene by a Netcare 911 emergency care practitioner, who treated the man for severe blood loss.” Once he was stabilised, the man was transported to hospital for further care. At the time of going to press, no case had been opened with police.
