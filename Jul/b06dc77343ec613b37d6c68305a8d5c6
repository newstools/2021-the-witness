Pietermaritzburg on Tuesday evening received its first out-of-province Covid-19 patient. As the country battles the third – and most devastating – wave of Covid-19 infection, bed space at medical facilities, especially in Gauteng where the spread of the virus is most rampant, is in limited supply. South Africa recorded 15 500 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 infections and 457 deaths, bringing the death toll to 62 628 on Tuesday. According to a statement by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), as of Tuesday, Gauteng is leading with 718 846 confirmed cases, followed by KwaZulu-Natal with 362 163 and the Western Cape at 335 116. In a statement, the Mi7 Group said Pietermaritzburg, on the other hand, does have some capacity to accommodate out-of-province patients. Mi7 said therefore, Vitalmed Emergency Services has been tasked to air transport multiple Covid-19 patients from Gauteng to medical facilities across the country. In Pietermaritzburg, Mi7 National Group’s Emergency Medical Services said they have been called upon as a service provider to transfer patients, and flight crew medical personnel, from Oribi Airport to designated hospitals. On Tuesday, after 6 pm, Mi7 EMS medics stationed themselves on the apron of the landing strip at Oribi Airport to receive the first patient and by midday on Wednesday were standing by to receive the next. “As management, we appeal to our communities to adhere to basic Covid-19 prevention protocols like the wearing of masks in public, regular handwashing and sanitising, social distancing and avoiding crowded spaces or areas of social gathering. “These measures are paramount in preventing the further spread of the virus,” said Mi7.
