Parts of the North Coast were brought to a standstill by an alleged group of Jacob Zuma supporters, who were travelling in convoy to Ballito. Videos showed them blocking off the entrance to KwaDukuza and forcing a tipper truck, transporting sand and stones, to drop its load in the middle of the road. Nazir Sadack, of the Community Emergency Reaction Team (CERT), in Tongaat, where there was distruption taking place, said the Tongaat Tollplaza was clear and traffic was flowing. He added that he and his team were preparing in case the convoy made an appearance. They had also asked local police to be present. Road Traffic Inspectorate spokesperson, Zinhle Mngomezulu Mali, said slow moving traffic was reported as the convoy made its way to Ballito. Itâ€™s believed that the convoy started at Umvoti, which was blocked for about 20 minutes.
