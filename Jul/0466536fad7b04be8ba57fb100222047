Twenty-seven people have been arrested for crimes linked to the torching of 33 trucks and looting of businesses in Mooi River on Friday night. KZN police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker on Saturday said those who were arrested faced charges of public violence, business burglary, malicious damage to property, and contravention of the Disaster Management Act lockdown regulations. They have not been named as they have not yet appeared in court. Naicker said the police were on a quest to track and trace more people were who involved in the violence that left the small KZN town in ruins. “This comes after an unconfirmed number of trucks were torched and looting of several businesses in the Mooi River CBD. Efforts are afoot to track and trace more suspects,” said Naicker. He said the N3 Mooi River toll plaza remained closed on Saturday afternoon as the clean-up continues. “Police and local authorities have joined efforts to remove the torched trucks, debris and burning tyres that were used by protesters to barricade several roads," said Naicker. Motorists are advised to use alternative routes or approach the toll plaza with caution. “It is with this in mind that the South African Police Service has condemned these acts of lawlessness that seek to undermine the authority of the state; and issued a stern warning to those behind the threats of more violence to refrain from these acts of incitement circulated on various social media platforms,” said Naicker.
