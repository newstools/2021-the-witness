Furious Telkom users are demanding answers from the telecoms giant for slow to non-existent connections to cellphone and wi-fi networks. In a response to a question on The Witness Facebook page about problems connecting to Telkom, readers from Wembley, Scottsville, Mkondeni, Lincoln Meade, Central Pietermaritzburg, Northdale, Raisethorpe, Ashburton and Mountain Rise all reported having issues with Telkom. There were also complaints from further afield. Residents in Hilton, Howick, Wartburg, Mooi River, Estcourt and Camperdown were all having problems with making calls and running offices. Other unhappy customers were in Durban North, Hillcrest, Botha’s Hill and Gillitts. One reader, Kerryn Rae Tarr, said that she had finally managed to get in touch with Telkom who said there was a massive outage in Pietermaritzburg, which the company was working on fixing. “Their online, app and SMS fault logging isn’t working ... Or if it “works”, it tells you to check that you have no outstanding bills... The consultant was super helpful and efficient though.” Another resident, said she was concerned about her dad’s safety as he constantly had no signal. She added: “It’s not good considering with it not being safe on farms either now days .... how can we even contact security or other emergency services? “Today at work we can't even access emails! That’s the most important thing considering the lockdown level four, we rely on emails now more than ever before.” The Witness tried to contact Telkom to get a response, but none has been received.
