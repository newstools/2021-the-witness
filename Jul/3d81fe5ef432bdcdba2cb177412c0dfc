The 36-year-old man, who is accused of killing his wife, with an angle grinder appeared in the Mbumbulu Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday morning, on charges of murder. The attack occurred in the Mkhazini area of KwaMakhutha, south of Durban. He appeared before Magistrate Pauline Moodley, after police arrested him in Estcourt, on Monday. He did not plead and the case was remanded to July 12 for a formal bail application. Commenting on KwaZulu-Natal Department of Social Development MEC, Nonhlanhla Khoza, said crimes against women such as domestic violence, gender-based violence, rape and murder, should not be allowed to fester in our society. She also applauded community members, civil society groups and political parties, who gathered outside court, calling on the magistrate not to grant bail to the accused. The MEC said people who meted out such violence against women did not deserve to stay within their communities. “We all have to fight violence directed at women and children,” Khoza said. “For years, we have been mourning about the tragic killings of women and children across our province. “These heinous murders of women and children by their boyfriends, fathers, husbands and uncles, who are supposed to love and protect them, must stop.” Khoza said that added tragic aspect of the case was that the wife had recently informed her sister about the abuse she had suffered for six years during her marriage. “She had hoped that the abuser would one day change his ways,” the MEC said. “We need communities, street by street, village by village, to take a stand to isolate those involved in abusing, raping and killing women and children. “Our communities must work with law enforcement agencies to ensure that perpetrators of these crimes get arrested.”
