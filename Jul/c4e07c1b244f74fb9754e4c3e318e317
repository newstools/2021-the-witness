Amazulu regiments (Amabutho) on Saturday joined the protest against the  sentencing of former president, Jacob Zuma. Led by Amabutho general, Mgilija Nhleko, the Amabutho on Saturday descended on Zuma's home in Nkandla, where they joined the former president's others backers already gathered outside of his residence. Members of the Mkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans (MKMVA) - who have vowed to prevent Zuma's arrest -  have also arrived at the former president's Nkandla residence. Zuma, who has been ordered by the ConCourt to hand himself in to the police by Sunday so he could start serving his 15 months sentence, is currently inside his Nkandla home. It is unclear whether Zuma, who is scheduled to address the "nation" on Sunday,  will come out to address his supporters. In its judgment the ConCourt  ordered police minister, Bheki Cele, to ensure that police arrest the former president should he fail to hand himself in.
