Three days after the Constitutional Court ordered former president Jacob Zuma to hand himself to the police so he could begin his 15 month sentence, there is still no indication if he will comply. There were expectations that Zuma, who is believed to be in Durban, was going to travel to his Nkandla homestead on Thursday to address his supporters who have been flocking to his home since Wednesday. On Thursday evening, Zuma’s daughter Dudu Zuma-Sambudla, tweeted a photograph of Zuma going through the ConCourt judgement but did not say what the former president thought about the court’s order. “Working late with @PresJGZuma, seriously studying the documents,” Zuma-Sambudla said on her Twitter account. On Thursday, Zuma supporters staged a protest rally outside his Nkandla homestead. This was despite the fact that the current Covid-19 adjusted level 4 lockdown restrictions prohibited such gatherings. While the Zuma supporters said they would continue holding rallies outside his home, on Friday morning it was still unclear whether the crowd would return. In its Tuesday ruling, the ConCourt gave Zuma five days to hand himself over to the police. Police Minister Bheki Cele has already indicated that police will arrest the former president should he defy the ConCourt order.
