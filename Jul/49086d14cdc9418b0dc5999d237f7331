Thirteen people have been arrested in connection with the pro-former president Jacob Zuma protests in Empangeni. The protesters on Friday hijacked trucks and forced the drivers to block roads before fleeing with the truck keys. Briefing the media on Friday, Police Minister Bheki Cele said police were viewing the Empangeni protests in a serious light. “We are considering bringing economic sabotage [charges] against them,” he said. The Zuma supporters have been staging a number of protests across KwaZulu-Natal since his arrest on Wednesday. Cele said the protests were now involving criminal elements. “For example, in KwaDukuza the protesters looted shops before blocking roads. “We would like to warn those planning to participate in these protests that police would come hard on them," he said.
