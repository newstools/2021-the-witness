As much as former president Jacob Zuma's Nkandla homestead has turned into a protest zone, it has also became a partying spot. With music blaring from giant speakers amid war cries from Amazulu warriors, activities outside the former president's home have attracted protesters and party revelers in equal measure. Sphelele Shozi, an unemployed local villager said he joined the protest because of "boredom". "With this lockdown life has become boring, especially here in Nkandla. "So when people started gathering here at Msholozi's place, I thought it's better for me to join them. At least there is little bit of fun here," he said. The gathering, which started on Wednesday has become a draw card for local villagers. However, for Thulisile Shandu, who hails from eMpangeni, about 80 kilometres from Nkandla, the gathering is a serious affair. "I have two children and would rather have been at home, particularly during this Covid situation. "But when I heard there were about to arrest Zuma, I couldn't just sit at home and just fold my arms. "I'm here to fight. Like these MK soldiers you see here, I feel like I'm a real soldier, who is here to fight for Zuma's freedom," she said. Nombuso Shangase, another local resident, said she was impressed with the support which her neighbour,Â  Zuma, has been getting. "Like me, it seems that a large section of the population has become annoyed with the unfair manner in which Zuma is being treated. "I'm here to say enough is enough," she said. The Zuma supporters, some of whom arrived by private cars while others arrived by foot, have turned the former president's home into a hive of activity. Amazulu izintombi, occasionally broke into traditional songs, while Mkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) members have been conducting drills on the road adjacent to the former president's home.
