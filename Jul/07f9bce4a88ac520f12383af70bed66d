A case of culpable homicide is being investigated, after one person died and three others were seriously injured in crash on Monday morning. Emergency services from ER24, KZN Emergency Medical Services (EMS), Public Safety and Okhahlamba Search and Rescue volunteers responded to the call, after a red VW Polo GTI veered off the road, before crashing down a steep embankment on the R103, a kilometre from the Road Traffic Inspectorate base. It is believed the car had been travelling from Embuzweni and was heading towards Roosboom, when tragedy struck.  Emergency services worked tirelessly on three passengers that were flung from the vehicle, while public safety had to use the jaws of life to cut free the entrapped driver. One of the passengers was declared dead on the scene, while the other seriously injured passengers and driver were stabilised and rushed to the Ladysmith Provincial Hospital. The cause of the collision is unknown at this stage and the name of the person who died has not been released. The SAPS are investigating.
