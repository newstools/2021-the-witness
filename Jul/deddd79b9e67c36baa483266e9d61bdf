A positive Covid-19 case in the British and Irish Lions camp has forced the kick-off for their match against the Sharks to be delayed. The match was original scheduled to kick-off at 7 pm on Wednesday but it has been pushed back by one hour to 8 pm. The delay is to accommodate the return of PCR test results from the tourists’ squad following the return of a positive test for Covid-19 among the management team, following a lateral flow test as part of the Tour screening programme which took place on Wednesday, July 7. The individual and four close contacts – including two players and two members of staff – are being isolated and assessed at the team hotel. All members of the touring party have since been PCR tested. “This evening’s game against the Sharks at Emirates Airline Park will still take place provided the subsequent round of PCR testing returns negative results later today,” said a statement from Saru. “The kick-off has been pushed back to allow for the testing process to be completed.”
