Supporters of former president Jacob fired shots in the air and intimidated the media at Nkandla on Friday. By Friday afternoon his supporters had begun flocking to his Nkandla homestead. Zuma's eldest son, Edward Zuma went to the extent of threatening to burn one of the media vehicles parked outside the Nkandla homestead. “I'm saying I don’t want this vehicle here. We are in a fighting spirit and will burn down this car if you don’t remove it now,” he said. Mkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) national spokesperson, Carl Niehaus, who is one of former president Jacob Zuma's supporters, arrived at Zuma's Nkandla homestead on Friday. Niehaus is due to brief the media later on Friday. The former president has until Sunday to hand himself to police so he can start serving his 15-month sentence in line with a ruling by the Constitutional Court, which found him guilty of contempt of court. However, Zuma supporters are adamant that he should not obey the ConCourt's order.
