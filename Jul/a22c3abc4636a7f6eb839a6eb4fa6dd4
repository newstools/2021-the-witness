The South African Medical Association (SAMA) wants 288 medical interns to get posts by Friday, July 9, or it will start legal proceedings against the government. In a statement, the organisation says the Department of Health, the acting minister of health, Mmamoloko Kubayi, and the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) has failed to ensure that interns, who graduated in March and April, can complete their compulsory community service in the public sector. Only once this internship has been completed, can interns register as medical practitioners. All of the 288 interns fulfil all the other criteria and are eligible for placements. “We have exhausted every possible avenue to get this resolved and we must now, unfortunately, turn to the courts for relief for these 288 interns because their futures hang in the balance,” Dr Angelique Coetzee, chairperson of SAMA said. “The failure of the DoH, the acting minister and the HPCSA to release allocations, and provide funding for these posts, is a violation of their legal obligations.” In terms of the Constitution and the Health Professions Act, health role-players have a statutory obligation to ensure placement of interns to complete their community service and enable them to register as healthcare professionals in SA. “At the beginning of June, the Department of Health undertook to release allocations before July 1, but this has not happened,” said Coetzee. “In the meantime, hospitals are unable to accept new patients because there are no available beds, and doctors, who are currently working, are facing mental and physical burnout from working extraordinarily long hours. “We have to take up the cause for these interns because their placement is in the best interests of everybody, including patients. “We cannot abide by a situation where our country desperately needs healthcare professionals but where the government does not place those who are qualified to help.”
