A 21-year-old man was recently sentenced to 19 years’ imprisonment at the Greytown Magistrate’s Court for murder and sexual assault. KZN police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said Buhlebodwa Zakahle Mntungwa’s sentence came after he stabbed Sinethemba Ndlovu (22) to death. She said that on September 22, 2019, Ndlovu was in the Msinga area with her cousin and colleagues attending an event. It became late and they did not have transport to take them to their accommodation so they decided to walk, said Gwala. While the women were walking they were approached by four men. One man then sexually assaulted one of the women. When the women tried to run away, one of the men grabbed Ndlovu and stabbed her on the left armpit and in the stomach. Gwala added the men then fled the scene. Ndlovu was taken to hospital where she died. Gwala added that Mntungwa was traced and arrested three days after the incident. “He was tried in court and was kept behind bars until his sentence,” she said.
