A toddler drowned in a pool in Pennington on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast on Thursday morning. Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst, said the 14-month-old girl was found submerged in the pool by a relative. “This morning Netcare 911 responded to a drowning at a residential complex,” he added. “Residents alerted Netcare 911 as well as the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI0) Shelly Beach who rushed to the scene to assist.” “On arrival the patient was found unresponsive and not breathing. It is not known how long the child had been submerged for.” Paramedics tried to resuscitate the toddler, but despite their best efforts her condition rapidly deteriorated and she was declared dead at the scene. In a recent statement, the NSRI said drowning is a leading cause of death in toddlers. The institute said places that toddlers face the greatest danger from water is in, and near to their home. “Children can drown in only a few centimetres of water which is why anything from backyard swimming pools to bathtubs and buckets pose a great risk. “The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) is urging parents and caregivers to ensure that their homes are water safe,” read the statement.
