With police under pressure to arrest former president Jacob Zuma before midnight on Wednesday, a contingent of police believed to be part of the team tasked with arresting him is on standby in Eshowe. Eshowe is about 80 kilometres from Zuma’s Nkandla homestead. Motorists driving past the Eshowe CBD on Wednesday afternoon told The Witness that there was a huge police presence in the area. “There are about four Nyalas and several police vans. “It seems as if something big is about to happen,” a motorist who drove past the town said. Police Minister Bheki Cele was on Wednesday in a last-ditch attempt to convince former president Jacob Zuma to hand himself to police. Cele, who held a meeting with members of the ANC KwaZulu-Natal leadership on Wednesday morning is rumoured to be wanting Zuma to hand himself over to the nearest police station rather than be fetched by police from his Nkandla home. The police minister, who has until Wednesday midnight to comply with a Constitutional Court order directing him to get Zuma arrested so he can start serving his 15-month sentence, could be charged with contempt of court if Zuma was not arrested by Wednesday midnight. Zuma supporters have since Tuesday been converging outside his Nkandla home in a bid to prevent police from arresting him. However, by Wednesday afternoon the Zuma supporters were yet to arrive at his Nkandla home. The ConCourt imposed the 15-month jail sentence on Zuma after he disobeyed their order compelling him to appear before the Zondo Commission investigating state capture.
