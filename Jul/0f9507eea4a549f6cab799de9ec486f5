UMkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) spokesperson, Carl Niehaus has vowed to continue his protest activities outside former president Jacob Zuma’s Nkandla home. He was responding to the AN’s national executive committee’s (NEC) decision to suspend him with immediate effect on Wednesday. In a notice to “temporary” suspend Niehaus’ membership and institute disciplinary action against him, ANC deputy secretary general, Jessie Duarte, said the NEC was concerned about his “inflammatory speeches made outside the home of former president Jacob Zuma” at the weekend. Duarte said Niehaus’ conduct brought the ANC into disrepute as he made those utterances while clad in the party’s regalia. “The NEC has reasonable apprehension that you will likely continue with your acts of misconduct and cause further damage to the good name and reputation of the ANC thereby bringing the organisation into disrepute,” said Duarte. Niehaus, who is planning to appeal the decision to suspend his ANC membership, said he remained the MKMVA national spokesperson. “My role as MKMVA spokesperson will not be affected by the decision to suspend my ANC membership. “I must also make it clear that whatever I said at Nkandla was in my capacity as MKMVA spokesperson,” he said. The MKMVA is at the forefront of the campaign to prevent the arrest of Zuma, who is due to be apprehended today in line with a ConCourt ruling.
