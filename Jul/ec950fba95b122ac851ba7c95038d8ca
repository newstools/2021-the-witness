Former president Jacob Zuma supporters on Thursday descended on his Nkandla homestead to lend him support. The Zuma supporters, who arrived in private cars and minibus taxis, vowed to defend the former president, who has been sentenced to 15-days imprisonment by the ConCourt. Sthembile Hlongwa, who came all the way from Ulundi, said police should rather arrest him rather than incarcerate a "79-year-old". “We are here to tell the judges and the police that Zuma is not going anywhere. “Personally, I'm prepared to go to prison on behalf of Zuma," she said. Zuma, who has been consulting his lawyers in Durban, was by Thursday afternoon yet to arrive at his Nkandla homestead. While it remains unclear whether Zuma will hand himself over to the police as ordered by the ConCourt, his key supporters said he will start consulting his family on Thursday. The JG Zuma Foundation on Thursday issued a statement lambasting the ConCourt's judgment, However, Zuma is yet to address his supporters on the ConCourt ruling. “We are waiting for him and we will tell him that he should defy the Constitutional Court Judges,” Hlongwa said.
