South Africa will be plunged into violence if former president Jacob Zuma is imprisoned. This is according to the Mkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA). Briefing the media at Zuma's Nkandla homestead on Friday, MKMVA national spokesperson, Carl Niehaus, said the MKMVA has already warned the ANC national  leadership that there would be "dire" consequences should Zuma be imprisoned. "Our country would  be torn apart. There will be instability and unrest," he said. Zuma has until Sunday to hand himself to police so he can begin serving his 15 month sentence in line with a ruling by the ConCourt ruling, which found him guilty of contempt of court. Niehaus said the MKMVA  would protect Zuma from arrest. "We are fundamentally opposed to the arrest and imprisonment of president Zuma. "MKMVA will form a human shield to protect president Zuma," he said. The media briefing outside Zuma's home on Friday ended abruptly after journalists were threatened with violence and gun shots were fired. The Zuma supporters,  some of who were seen consuming
alcohol, had earlier chased away photographers who were taking photos of them
outside the former president's home. When journalists asked Mkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans
Association (MKMVA) spokesperson, Carl Niehaus  questions during a press
conference held outside Zuma's home, they were booed and labelled
"sell-outs" by a group of the former president's supporters. The protesters, some of who brandished  firearms
and knob kerries, told journalists to "leave" Nkandla. "You come here and tell us about Covid-19 
restrictions, who do you think you are. You must leave now," one of the
protesters said. The press conference ended after journalists refused to further participate in the event.
