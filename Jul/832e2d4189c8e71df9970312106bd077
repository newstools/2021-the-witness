The N3 freeway, near the Mooi Plaza, has been cleared after protesters shut down the busy national road. Thania Dhoogra, operations manager at N3 Toll Concession, protesters started burning tyres and causing traffic chaos at around 11.30 am on Friday. By 12.15 pm, police had dispersed the protesters, cleared the scene and traffic was flowing. “Sporadic flare ups of protest action may occur near Mooi Plaza. Law enforcement services are on scene and will be monitoring the situation closely,” Dhoogra said. “Road users are advised to approach the area with caution.” Protests have been taking place across KwaZulu-Natal in response to the imprisonment of former president Jacob Zuma. On Thursday, Zuma started his 15-month prison sentence at the Estcourt Correctional Centre. Protesters also burned tyres on the N3, near Cliffdale and Peacevale, on Friday. The debris was cleared. Zinhle Mngomezulu, spokesperson for the Road Traffic Inspectorate, said all tollgates and roads were open and law enforcement officials were monitoring the roads closely. A police helicopter has also been deployed to monitor the situation on the roads. “Everywhere is open. I was told there were arrests and those arrests were effected by the SAPS (South African Police Service),” said Mngomezulu.
