The protests, predominantly in KwaZulu-Natal and some parts of Gauteng, affected Eskom's ability to provide electricity as it posed danger to its technicians providing services in these communities. “Eskom will not dispatch technicians
in areas where there are protests. Safety of our employees remains our priority
and therefore where we feel our employees are not safe, we will withdraw them
immediately. Our teams will do risk assessment before dispatching technicians,”
Eskom distribution group executive, Monde Bala, on Sunday. He said customers who had logged faults were requested to be patient as they might experience delays in response time to
resolve their faults. "Please
bear with us, we will attend to the queries when there is an indication that
the protest has calmed down. Our teams will continue to conduct risk assessments,
hence our technicians will only be dispatched when it is safe to do so. "We
sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused," said Bala.
