Members of the Mkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans (MKMVA) conducted a drill outside former president Jacob Zuma's home in Nkandla on Saturday. The MKMVA, which is one of the ANC factions supporting Zuma, has vowed to prevent his arrest.  Zuma, who has been ordered by the ConCourt to hand himself in to the police by Sunday so he could start serving his 15 months sentence, is currently inside his Nkandla home. He arrived there late on Friday night.
