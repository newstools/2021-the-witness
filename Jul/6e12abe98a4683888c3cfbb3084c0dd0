As violent protests spread across the province, Ugu District Municipality's water tankers, a fresh produce market and municipal offices were torched in the KZN South Coast on Monday. According to Ugu’s municipal spokesperson, France Zama, municipal vehicles were also set alight by the mob. He added that the market was also looted of all goods in stock. “The full extent of damages is yet to be determined. Water tankers were restricted from delivering water due to the escalating acts of torching trucks. "In view of the ongoing volatility in some parts of the district which has manifested into violent protests, residents are advised of a potential disruption to water and sanitation services. The municipality will continue to monitor the situation until it becomes conducive to deliver portable water to affected areas,” he said. On the road, KZN police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the N2 near Umgababa and Umkomaas remained a no-go area. Residents have also been warned to stay away from the Port Shepstone area as there were ongoing protests. Sources told The Witness that they saw a large crowd moving past Rocky Ridge outside of Ramsgate, headed to the Ramsgate CBD. Protest action also continued in Umzinto and the administrators of the local chat groups warned locals to stay away from the Umzinto area as it is currently unsafe. On Monday morning, it was confirmed that several other stores in the Umzinto CBD were being looted. Looting incidents were also reported in the Gamalakhe township, near Margate. Meanwhile, Ray Nkonyeni Municipality spokesperson, Simon April, said some of the services provided by the municipality were  disrupted by the unrest “The main service that has been affected is that of refuse collection and we therefore plead with our communities to keep the refuse inside their yards up until the situation is conducive for the service and other services to resume,” he said.
