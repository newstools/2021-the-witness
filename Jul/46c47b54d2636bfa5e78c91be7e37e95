Former president Jacob Zuma, who is scheduled to start his 15-month sentence in the next few days, will arrive at his Nkandla homestead on Thursday afternoon. The former president was not at his Nkandla homestead when the ConCourt imposed the sentence on him on Tuesday. According to sources within the Zuma support network, which includes the Mkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA), Zuma's convoy will make a stop at Eshowe before proceeding to Nkandla. “As I speak, we are leaving Durban, the convoy has more than 30 vehicles,” the source said. Some Zuma supporters are expected to gather at Eshowe, about 50 kilometers from his Nkandla homestead, to greet him. The ConCourt gave Zuma the jail sentence after the former president defied its order for him to give evidence at the Zondo Commission investigating state capture and corruption.
