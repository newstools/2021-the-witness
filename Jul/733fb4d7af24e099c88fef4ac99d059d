The Pietermaritzburg High Court hears Zuma’s application for the suspension of the warrant of arrest against him. Zuma’s supporters had been camping outside his Nkandla home since Tuesday last week in a bid to prevent police from arresting him. However, they took a breather on Monday after the Pietermaritzburg High Court agreed to consider his application against his warrant of arrest. Zuma has also lodged an application with the Constitutional Court in a bid to have it set aside its ruling last week where he was found guilty of contempt of court for disobeying an order to appear before the Zondo Commission investigating state capture.
