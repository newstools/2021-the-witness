As unrest action grips KwaZulu-Natal and the country, Pietermaritzburg residents in various suburbs have formed groups to mobilise and fight back. In one suburb, security and police gathered outside a shop, some armed with firearms. The community members said they would defend themselves against any criminal activity. Videos and voice notes were also doing their rounds on numerous WhatsApp chat groups calling on the community to stand together. “If the community stands together, we will win this thing,” said one of the voice notes. So called group leaders were even heard on social media arranging a time and place for the community to come together to charter a way forward. And as neighbourhood groups' WhatsApp messages became increasingly frantic, neighbourhoods began to also call for volunteers to join civilian protection forces. They gathered to discuss strategies to defend property and lives. They moved around in groups, responding to sporadic incidents that flared up. In addition, new chat groups were being formed with links on existing community groups to join. This was to keep residents updated as to what was happening in the KZN's capital city. Community groups planned to set up roadblocks to block access to their suburbs. Numerous videos of damage to property, looting, alleged criminals caught in the act and recoveries of stolen goods were also circulating on social media. In addition, there was also fake news doing its rounds. Magma Security and Investigations director, Shaheen Suleiman, said that residents and community groups should not confront the mobs. “We want residents to be the eyes and ears on the ground. If you see a group of about 15 or more people then contact your local security company and police. We all need to work together. No one must use live rounds. Let the people who know how to deal with this deal with it,” added Suleiman.
