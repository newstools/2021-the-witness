In a bid to improve their scrum, the Sharks have enlisted the services of former Georgia hooker Akvsenti Giorgadze as their scrum consultant. The appointment of the 45-year-old Giorgadze was confirmed by the franchise yesterday. “We are excited to welcome the experienced Akvsenti Giorgadze as the Cell C Sharks scrum consultant,” said the Sharks via their Twitter page.

He parted ways with the French outfit in June last year. Giorgadze represented his country at least 64 times during his playing days. The appointment comes soon after the Sharks confirmed beefing up their Sean Everitt-led technical team by experienced coaches in Irish-born Noel McNamara, the experienced John McFarland and Springbok Sevens head coach Neil Powell. The Sharks are preparing to participate in the United Rugby Championship against PRO14 sides in September.
