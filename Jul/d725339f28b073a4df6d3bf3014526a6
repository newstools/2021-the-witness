While a voicenote urging supporters of former President Jacob Zuma to flock to Nkandla to support him is doing the rounds, there is no confirmation that it is a genuine appeal. The unconfirmed voicenote that has been doing the rounds on Whatsapp has asked supporters who are able to do so to drive to Nkandla. In the voice message a man who did not identify himself says he has been reliably informed of a special request from Zuma’s home. He said he has been reliably informed that the South African Police Service (SAPS) was making its way to the former president’s home. The man said the special request came from Zuma’s home. “Everyone must come and support uBaba in this situation, the request comes from KwaZuma ngo that we must all go to eNkandla, we must go and support uBaba and give him support as the SAPS are heading there now. “We also have a reliable source from the SAPS that is why there is this call from eNkandla that we must go there now,” said the man. He added that all supporters have been called. “We are called, for every action there is a reaction, momentum before collision is equal to momentum after collision, is clear we shouldn’t relax. Let us all move, all the ways are going to eNkandla.” The Jacob Zuma Foundation was unavailable to comment on the voicenote.
