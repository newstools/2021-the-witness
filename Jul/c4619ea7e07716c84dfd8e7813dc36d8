It was an emotional moment when Durban man, Mohamed Safwan Amod, was reunited with his dog, Romeo after more than two months apart. “There’s no words that can really describe it until you lose someone close to you in your family and then find him again. It was a big void in my heart that has been filled,” said Amod. Amod said he lost Romeo, a white Swiss Shepherd dog, in May, when he and another puppy belonging to his cousin, ran off after the gate of his Queensburgh home was temporarily left open. Unfortunately, said Amod, the other dog has not been found yet. “We searched for Romeo everywhere. We put up pamphlets, posters and even messages on social media but we did not receive any positive feedback,” said Amod. It was through a chance moment, when Amod’s uncle saw an adoption advert on Facebook with Romeo’s picture on it. When they contacted the photographer of the advert, he led them to the Kloof and Highway SPCA. “We contacted the SPCA on Sunday night and told them that it was our dog. Unfortunately I had to wait until the next day to meet him but they were very helpful,” said Amod. Although Romeo has a microchip, Amod said their details were not loaded on it and that is why the SPCA could not reach him. Amod said Romeo was found in Clermont township, near Pinetown. In a statement released by the SPCA, they said they received a “frantic phone call” from a dog owner who said his dog was in their care. “First thing on Monday morning when we opened our doors the family was there waiting and ready to claim their beloved pet and member of their family,” they said. Amod said Romeo, who is two years old, was in good health and happy to be back home. “You don’t understand the excitement and joy I am feeling right now to have him back,” said Amod.
