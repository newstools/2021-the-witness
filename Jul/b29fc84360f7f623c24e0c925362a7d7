With a few hours left before his possible arrest, former president Jacob Zuma was on Wednesday afternoon still in "high spirits". Speaking to journalists outside Zuma's Nkandla homestead, the former president's son, Edward said his father was “not depressed at all”. "He is on top of the world," he said. By Wednesday afternoon police minister, Bheki Cele and the ANC KwaZulu-Natal top brass were still trying to persuade Zuma to hand himself to the police instead of waiting for the cops to fetch him at home. However, Edward said his father would not go to prison. "As the Zuma family we are prepared to die than allow him to go prison. "Even if he agrees, we will ensure that he does not go there," he said. The ConCourt, which sentenced Zuma for 15 months for disobeying its order for him to appear before the Zondo Commission, gave Cele until Wednesday midnight to ensure that the former president was arrested.
