The Sharks have made only one change to their team that will face the British and Irish Lions in Johannesburg on Wednesday. The match, which will be the second outing for the tourists in South Africa, is scheduled to kick off at 7 pm at Ellis Park Stadium. The touring Lions started their tour with a resounding 56-14 victory of the Joburg-based Lions on Saturday. Sean Everitt’s men will be looking to return to winning ways after their last week defeat to Western Province in the Currie Cup. Sharks skipper and loose forward Phendulani “Phepsi” Buthelezi is back on the team after missing the last outing due to a mild concussion. “We have only played two games in the Carling Currie Cup, but our group has been together for some time and they’re looking forward to the challenge,” said Everitt. “The chief goal is that we go into this game well-prepared and for the players to understand what’s coming their way. Not many of our players in the [Currie Cup] squad have international experience and that includes Super Rugby, so yes, this is a big challenge. “We have to get the fundamentals right otherwise we will be punished on the day.”
