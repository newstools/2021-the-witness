The man who is alleged to have killed Anele Bhengu (21) in
what is believed to be a hate crime, no longer wants to apply for bail. Thulani Nandos (39) appeared briefly in the Umbumbulu
Magistrateâ€™s Court on Thursday for a formal bail application, but changed his
mind. Natasha Kara, National Prosecuting Authority provincial
spokesperson, said Nandos has been remanded in custody until August 3. He faces charges of murder and assault with intent to do
grievous bodily harm. Bhengu was found brutally murdered in a ditch in
KwaMakhutha, south west of Durban last month. Police said Bhengu had been raped, her throat was slit and
she had been stabbed multiple times. Bhengu was a member of the LGBTQI+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,
Trans, Queer and Intersex) community and her death has been viewed by many as a
hate crime.
