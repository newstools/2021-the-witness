Teachers and staff in the basic education sector are urged to go to vaccination sites to get their Johnson & Johnson jabs. The programme is ongoing, despite the fact that schools closed early for the June/July holidays, following President Cyril Ramaphosaâ€™s recent decision to move the country to level 4 of the national lockdown. More than 333 000 teachers and support staff have been vaccinated since the start of the campaign on June 23. The first phase of the programme targeted 300 000 teachers and support staff, based on the number of doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccines provided to the sector. On July 1, 300 052 people in the nine provinces had been vaccinated. The basic education sector has received an additional 289 000 doses of the J&J vaccine, which officials hope will enable them to reach all 582 564 teachers and non-teaching staff. Support staff from independent schools, food handlers, screeners, cleaners and early childhood development practitioners will be also included in the roll out programme. Although vaccination is voluntary, the government is urging all those in the basic education sector to protect themselves and help save others by choosing vaccination.
