A cellphone shop in the Tongaat CBD was one of many stores that were completely vandalised and looted during Monday’s protest action. The cellphone shop shared a video on its Facebook page, showing the safety gate on the floor while many people rushed into the store. Also on the post, the store thanked the people of Tongaat for their services and support over the years as they tried to uplift the community and provide jobs on the main street of the town. “The looting of our store was uncalled for and has destroyed us,” they said.
