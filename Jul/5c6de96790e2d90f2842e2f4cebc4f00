The IFP is demanding that KZN MEC for Social Development Nonhlanhla Khoza reveals when social workers will be vaccinated. During a virtual media briefing on alert level four recently, Minister of Social Development Lindiwe Zulu said negotiations were at an advanced stage with the Department of Health to ensure the inclusion of social workers as a priority group for vaccination. Les Govender, the party’s provincial spokesperson for social development, said he is perplexed by the MEC’s silence on the issue. “She has not even said whether she has held discussions with her counterpart, the KZN MEC for Health Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu, on the prioritisation and inclusion of social workers in the vaccination programme. “The IFP expects the MEC to tell the public when and how the vaccination of social workers will be rolled out. We are calling for social workers, and all social work staff, to be prioritised for the Covid-19 vaccine as it is rolled out in KwaZulu-Natal and nationwide.” ALSO READ | Push to declare social workers as essential Govender said that increasing economic stress on families is likely to heighten the need for welfare support, while social isolation could increase tension at home, cause anxiety and put children at higher risk of violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation. “Vaccinating social workers will allow them to carry on with their duties of delivering crucial services for children, such as welfare and protection services. “When social workers are assigned cases, they now also have to weigh the risk of harm, between the children and family members and themselves, when a family is not following Covid-19 prevention measures. “The IFP believes that extensive vaccination against Covid-19 will greatly reduce the risk of the virus spreading.”
