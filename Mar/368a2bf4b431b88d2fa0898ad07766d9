The SA Weather Service (Saws) has warned that parts of KwaZulu-Natal could be affected by severe thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon. Saws said the severe thunderstorms are expected over the south-western parts and Midlands of KZN this afternoon, and are expected to move towards coastal areas by the evening. The thunderstorms are expected to be accompanied by heavy downpours, hail, strong winds and severe lightning.  The impact of these storms could lead to localized damage to infrastructure especially informal settlements and rural areas. Saws also warned of localised flooding of low lying bridges and susceptible roads, poor driving conditions due to slippery roads and poor visibility which may result in minor car accidents, localized damage to infrastructure due to strong winds and hail and lightning which may be a danger to life and live stock.
