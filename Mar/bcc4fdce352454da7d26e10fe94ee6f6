The Sharks will have Lukhanyo Am back as skipper against the Lions in SA Rugby’s Franchise Cup this weekend, but Springbok captain Siya Kolisi is still not ready to make his debut for the coastal side. Sharks coach Sean Everitt on Thursday named his team that will cross swords with the Lions at 4.15 pm on Saturday at Ellis Park in Johannesburg. The hard-working Am and the recently-signed Kolisi were not fielded in the first two matches of the newly-created Franchise Cup, which is a friendly series designed to prepare South African franchises for the Rainbow Cup’s launch in April. The two stars were placed in a “conditioning group” by Everitt as part of plans to have seniors and youngsters in the squad in the best possible condition for the Rainbow Cup by separating on-field and off-field sessions in a strategic way. But while Am is now returning, Kolisi will continue to work on himself in a focused way. Overall, Everitt has made a number of changes, bringing back some of the players that formed part of the initial conditioning group, but retaining a few players that featured in the first two games - and introduced a couple new faces. This includes recent signing Le Roux Roets in the No.4 jersey. Everitt’s team had a home win and away loss in their first two games. Sharks team to face Lions: 1. Mzamo Majola 2. Dan Jooste 3.
