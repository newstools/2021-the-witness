WARNING - GRAPHIC CONTENT A group of people claiming to be Umkhonto We Sizwe Military Veterans allegedly burned down a stall belonging to a foreigner in Durban on Monday morning. According to eyewitnesses, the group of about 10 men were carrying Molotov cocktails and threw them towards the stall. In a video supplied to The Witness, the attackers ganged up on a man identified as a foreigner who tried to resist and beat him with metal rods.  The Witness understands that the man was taken to Addington Hospital for treatment and is in a critical condition. The burnt down stall belonged to Uber Syll, a 55-year-old man from Senegal who said he has been in South Africa for 25 years. “I’m going to do nothing, because the (South African) government is supposed to help us and look after us but nobody helped us,” he said. “We’ll just try and work again.” Last week The Witness published the story of Jobsin Fundi, 19, who had to get stitches on his head after being attacked by a mob at the Durban flea market. The Witness has contacted Durban Metro Police and the provincial South African Police Service for comment but so far has not received a response. This is a developing story.
