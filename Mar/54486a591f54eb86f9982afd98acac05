The ANC’s Women’s League in KwaZulu-Natal said it will not be celebrating International Women’s Day on March 8 this year, but have opted to rather visit the emaHlutshini Tribal authorities in the Hlathikhulu area, northern KZN, to engage izinduna there following the “patriarchal abuse” imposed towards a 71-year-old woman. The ANCWL-KZN said the woman lost her husband in November last and she refused to wear inzila, commonly black or navy clothing, for the mourning period of a year following the death of her husband. ANCWL provincial Secretary, Nonhlanhla Gabela, said she and her husband had an agreement that she will not wear inzila when he died. However, Gabela said the woman has since appeared before the tribal court and is being accused of inviting curses into the village. Gabela said emaHlutshini izinduna have allegedly attributed the recent hailstorm, which has destroyed crops in the fields, to the curse caused by the woman as a result of her not mourning her husband. She has been summoned to re-appear before the tribal court this week where the izinduna will decide on her fate. “We are saddened by the incident and we cannot be silent, otherwise gender equity will remain a dream. We will not tolerate any form of abuse directed to women and we are meeting with the EmaHlutshini Tribal Authority today [Monday] to discuss the matter,” said Gabela.
