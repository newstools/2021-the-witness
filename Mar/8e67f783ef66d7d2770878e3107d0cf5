Former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede and 20 other accused have been charged with 2 786 various counts of fraud and corruption. Gumede and others are charged for an irregular 2017 Durban Solid Waste tender that cost in excess of R430 million. This was revealed in a packed courtroom on Tuesday at the Durban Specialised Commercial Crimes Court. Ashika Lucken, state prosecutor, handed the court an audit report, annexures and a 324-page indictment. "Everything that the state will rely upon has been downloaded to a hard drive and supplied to the defence," she said. The matter was postponed in December last year to allow the state to finalise their documentary evidence. Three eThekwini councillors were arrested last week and added on to the list. Magistrate Dawn Somaroo said the matter will be transferred to the Durban High court for pretrial. The 21 accused are expected back in court on 14 June 2021. Natasha Kara, National Prosecuting Authority provincial spokesperson, declined to comment whether there will be further arrests before 14 June.
