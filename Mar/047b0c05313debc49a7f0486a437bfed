The N2 highway between Harding and Port Shepstone remains closed on Wednesday morning as South Coast residents continue to protest against water shortages. Also, the N2 between Hibberdene and Port Shepstone is still closed and protesters are stoning vehicles. Protest action has also been seen on the R102 which is now closed as well. Louisiana residents also told The Witness that disgruntled residents have also set alight the home of a councillor and a creche in the area. Port Shepstone police are yet to confirm this. *This is a developing story.
