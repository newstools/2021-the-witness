 Taxi operators belonging to the Howick and Mphophemeni taxi association embarked on a go-slow protest in the city and blocked several roads leading onto the N3 and around the city on Wednesday. Messages were being circulated to motorists on social networks warning them to avoid the Cedara and Hilton areas as well as the Peter Brown exit and Chatterton offramp as there was traffic due to the taxi protest. The taxi operators congregated in Prince Alfred Street at the office of the Provincial department of transport. Members of the taxi association told The Witness that they were tired and frustrated after they claim they have been pushed out of the Masukwane taxi rank, which they say legally is their rank to occupy. Filling Prince Alfred Street with their taxis, bringing traffic to a complete stand still in the upper area of the road, taxi drivers marched outside the Road traffic inspectorate (RTI) offices on Wednesday to air their grievances and look for a way forward. “The main issue is that of the occupancy of the Masukwane Taxi rank. This is where we pick up and drop off people who live and work in Howick. The Pietermaritzburg taxi drivers have threatened our drivers on numerous occasions and today [Wednesday] chased us out of the rank at gunpoint,” said Howick taxi association spokesperson Mvusi Mkhize, adding that this issue has been going on since 2016. After concluding a meeting with the RTI, Mkhize told The Witness they needed answers and a way forward by Wednesday as they have been threatened with violence to vacate their taxi rank and if they were to return, which the RTI have advised, they know violence will ensue. By Wednesday afternoon, Howick and Mphophemeni drivers are currently still occupying the upper area of Prince Alfred Street outside the RTI offices.
