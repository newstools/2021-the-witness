A 36-year-old woman died after jumping out of a moving taxi. Shawn Herbst, from Netcare 911, said the taxi was travelling along Trelawney Road in Pietermaritzburg on Tuesday morning. He said according to passengers, the woman was seated in the front seat. “She sustained some trauma to her head, she was declared deceased on the scene when paramedics arrived,” said Herbst. “The taxi did stop; the taxi was in motion when she jumped out of it. SAPS soon arrived afterwards to cordon off the area,” he said. Chairperson for Santaco uMgungundlovu regional taxi council Bheki Sokhela confirmed the incident and said it happened near Southgate SuperSpar. Sokhela said the taxi was travelling from town to Mpumelelo, near France, when the woman jumped out near the Trelawney Road intersection. “The passengers said the woman just opened the door while the taxi was still moving and fell onto the ground and died instantly. “We would like to convey our deepest condolences to the woman’s family for their loss,” said Sokhela.
