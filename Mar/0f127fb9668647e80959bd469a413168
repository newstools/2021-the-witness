MyLife Dusi Canoe Marathon stars Andy Birkett and Christie Mackenzie showed clear intention to defend their K1 titles by claiming huge victories on Day 1 of the 2021 race on Thursday. The 70th edition of the Dusi started at Camps Drift in Pietermaritzburg and will finish at Durban’s Blue Lagoon on Saturday. In the men’s race, Birkett led for most of the first day and reached the finish at Dusi Bridge in the Valley of a Thousand Hills in a time of 2hrs 39mins 08secs for the 42km stage. He was ahead of last year’s winning K2 partner, Khumbulani Nzimande, and Msawenkosi Mtolo who took the second and third spots respectively on Thursday. Nzimande was at the finish line in a time of 2:50:59 while Mtolo registered 2:51:02, but the pair will have to deal with not losing their potential podium spots to veteran paddler Hank McGregor who finished fourth in 2:51:47 on Thursday. In the women’s race, Mackenzie finished almost eight minutes ahead of Jordan Peek who came second on Day 1. Mackenzie completed stage 1 in a time of 3:15:29 while Peek registered 3:23:23. Olympic medallist Bridgitte Hartley finished third with a time of 3:32:23. More than 700 paddlers are taking part in the demanding race despite the Covid-19 pandemic and say they are happy with the water level.
