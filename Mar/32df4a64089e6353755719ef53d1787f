The province needs R10,8 billion to address infrastructure backlogs within its municipalities. This figure that does not include bulk water, sanitation or electricity interventions or maintenance of municipal roads, according to the Democratic Alliance in KZN. “The information is revealed in a written parliamentary reply by KZN Cogta MEC, Sipho Hlomuka, to questions by the DA,” Chris Pappas, DA KZN spokesperson on Cogta, said in a statement. According to the reply, the breakdown for KZN backlogs also includes the following: · Sanitation: R2 788 686 860 · Water: R3 982 685 675 · Electricity: R659 746 770 (this excludes Eskom-supplied areas, Msunduzi and eThekwini) “The DA is deeply concerned by these figures. “Equally alarming is that, in addition to the R10,8 billion, the province’s ANC-run government also requires capital to the tune of R100 billion to implement its water master plan and deal with the still incomplete electricity master plan. “At this rate and with the current policies in place, the DA is very worried that there will soon be a total infrastructure collapse in many municipalities across KZN,” said Pappas. He questioned where the ANC will find the money amid budget cuts and a shrinking tax base.
