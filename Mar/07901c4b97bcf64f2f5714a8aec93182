A truck burst into flames on the N3 southbound, near the Liberty Midlands Mall on Sunday causing it to Jack knife resulting in the closure of the road. “The driver had mechanical problems which caused the truck to jack knife and catch alight,” “The driver is fine and luckily escaped without sustaining any injuries. The truck was carrying manganese which is still intact after firemen arrived to douse the flames,” said RTI KwaZulu-Natal spokesperson, Zinhle Mali. The road has since been closed and traffic officers have been diverting traffic into the CBD. Mali said motorists can expect the road to be closed for a maximum of two hours.
