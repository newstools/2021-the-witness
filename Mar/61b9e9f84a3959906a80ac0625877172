Two vehicles drove into the taxi rank on Shepstone Street in Richmond on Wednesday, opening fire in the rank before fleeing the scene in two different directions. According to community police forum member, Ricky Jugree, the two vehicles entered the taxi rank after 12 pm. “Two cars went in and [the occupants] opened fire. There is blood on the scene, meaning someone has been shot. The two cars thereafter left the scene via two different routes,” said Jugree, adding he was still waiting for further information. Police have cordoned off the scene and further investigations are underway. This comes after a 34-year-old man was shot and killed in a drive-by shooting on Shepstone Street by unknown people on Tuesday, just before 10.30 am. The man was shot multiple times on his upper body and was declared dead at the scene.
