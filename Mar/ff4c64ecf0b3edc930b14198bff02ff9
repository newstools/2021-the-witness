The University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) decided to suspend academic programme pending the outcome of the ongoing dialogue between national government and the various bodies representing student formations in South Africa. The academic programme is suspended for the week - from Monday, March 15 until Friday, March 19, 2021 - both dates inclusive. The institution issued a statement saying remote online registration for 2021 will continue for all returning students and first-entry undergraduates. University management will inform staff and students on the dates for re-commencement of the semester.
