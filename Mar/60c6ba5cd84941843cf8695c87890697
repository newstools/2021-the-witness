A Pietermaritzburg police officer who was on duty was shot dead on Thursday morning at Swapo settlement near Eastwood. Police spokesperson Colonel Brenda Muridili, said the 39-year-old detective sergeant based at Mountain Rise police station, was killed in the early hours of Thursday morning while tracing an attempted murder case suspect. It is still unclear how many police officers were at the scene. While the attempted murder victim was pointing out a house in the area, shots were fired from a different shack and a police officer was shot at the back of his head and died. Muridili said the gunman attempted to flee the scene but was engaged in a shootout with police and he was shot dead. “The 32-year-old suspect was found in possession of three firearms and ammunition including a firearm belonging to the police officer he had just allegedly killed,” said Muridili. When The Witness arrived in the area on Thursday morning, community members, some who were still in their night gowns, gathered behind the police tape and watched as police combed the scene for evidence. Many of the community members where clueless about what had happened. “I didn’t even hear any gunshots. I was woken up by the commotion outside as people were rushing to see what had happened,” said a community member who asked not to be named. *This is a developing story.
