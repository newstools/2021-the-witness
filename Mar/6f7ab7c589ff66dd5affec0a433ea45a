Sharks coach Sean Everitt on Monday opted to stick with the same matchday 23 but made three changes to his starting line-up for their second outing in the preparation series against the Cheetahs. Both the Sharks and Cheetahs will be looking to make it two out of two when they meet in Bloemfontein on Wednesday at 7 pm. The Durbanites started the preparation series with an emphatic victory over the Griquas, while the Cheetahs defeated the Stormers. The changes see John-Hubert Meyer starts at tighthead ahead of Michael Kumbirai, who is set to start off the bench. Young flyhalf Jordan Chait has replaced Manie Libbok, who moves to the bench, while Thaakir Abrahams and Werner Kok exchange jerseys with the former getting an opportunity to start at right wing. Centre Jeremy Ward will once again lead the side in the absence of regular skipper Lukhanyo Am.
