Powerful paddlers Andy Birkett and Christie Mackenzie successfully defended their K1 (singles) titles in the 2021 MyLife Dusi Canoe Marathon in Durban on Saturday with sizeable leads over their respective rivals. Birkett started the final day of the gruelling, three-day competition with a hefty 18-minute lead at Inanda Dam and never looked back to claim his 11th title overall at Blue Lagoon in Durban in the race’s 70th edition. He finished the race almost 21 minutes ahead of veteran, internationally-renowned paddler Hank McGregor, while Under-23 star David Evans took third place, a further nine minutes behind. “It has been three awesome days,” said the elated Birkett, whose overall time was 8hrs 03mins 54secs. He also extended the record for the most consecutive Dusi victories to eight on Saturday. In the women’s race, Mackenzie started the final day with a strong eight-minute lead but that was cut to six minutes at the end over second-placed Jordan Peek after capsizing her boat four times. “There was a bit of drama, but I kept my wits about me until the finish. The goal was to win Dusi, so I am stoked,” said Mackenzie, whose overall time was 9hrs 42mins 16secs. Former Olympic Games participant Bridgitte Hartley took third spot, roughly 20 minutes behind Peek. More than 700 people took part in the event despite the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2022 the race will revert to an official K2 (doubles) format, although paddlers can still enter single or three-person boats (K3).
