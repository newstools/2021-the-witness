A man has been arrested in connection with an incident where a lodge owner from Emanguzi in northern KwaZulu-Natal, as well as one of his two armed attackers, was killed in November 2020. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele said Patrick Craig Pedlar (57), an ex policeman and owner of the Palm Tree Lodge in Emanguzi was attacked on November 10 last year whilst loading and paying community members for firewood he had bought on the roadside. Two armed attackers grabbed him by his neck and pointed handguns at his head. He resisted and subsequently an exchange of shots occurred during which Pedlar was shot twice in his head and one of his assailants - Mandlenkosi Siyabonga Khumalo (28) - was also shot twice by the lodge owner. Khumalo died at the scene and Pedlar died in hospital the next day. Police recovered an air rifle from Khumalo as well as Pedlarâ€™s 9 mm pistol. The second attacker, who also had a handgun, escaped. Mbele said members of the Vryheid based Provincial Organised crime Investigations Unit took over the investigation and soon identified the missing gunman. They commenced to try and trace him and on Friday, March 19, a 27-year-old man was arrested. He is expected to appear in the Emanguzi Magistrates Court on Tuesday in connection with two counts of murder.
