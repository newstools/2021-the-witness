A raging fire destroyed part of the Dynamic Fibre Moulding (DFM) factory in Mandeni on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast on Sunday. The fire which started on Sunday afternoon was finally brought under control by 1 am on Monday morning. Despite massive challenges with water supply, the majority of the factory was saved and the fire was mostly restricted to the warehouse and stock area. “[There was] outstanding team work by DFM staff and fire fighters from Sappi, Rural Metro, KwaDukuza and Umlalazi,” said an emergency responder on scene. “I was asked to pass on thanks to each and every person from the Mandeni community who came out and provided food, water and refreshments for the teams on site,” he said. One person who was transported to hospital for treatment for smoke inhalation is doing well, he added.
