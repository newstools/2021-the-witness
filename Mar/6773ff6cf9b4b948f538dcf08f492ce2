The Department of Home Affairs will be offering birth registration services over the Human Rights Day weekend at health facilities nationwide. It is part of a plan to assist parents to register their children within 30 days of birth as is required by law. It is the second weekend that Home Affairs is extending services to help parents and their children access key government and other services. This year’s Human Rights Day is being commemorated under the theme: “The year of Charlotte Maxeke: promoting human rights in the Age of Covid-19”. By registering births immediately or within the first 30 days, parents contribute in promoting their children’s human rights. Birth registration marks the beginning of the constitutional right to citizenship and protects the child’s right to a name and nationality at birth. During the first weekend registration drive on March 13, 2 060 births were registered. Home Affairs officials will be on duty from 8 am to 3 pm on Saturday, March 20, Sunday, March 21 and Monday, March 22. Everyone who comes to register their child must observe social distancing, sanitise their hands regularly and wear masks.
