Ten people were left critically injured after a full taxi with passengers overturned on theÂ  N3 Pietermaritzburg bound, near the Hammersdale off ramp on Friday morning. Garrith Jamieson, an advanced life support paramedic, said it appeared the taxi had ejected all its passengers while overturning. "Approximately ten people were stabilised on the scene with injuries from minor to critical before being transported to various Durban Hospitals for the further treatment that they required," he said. At this stage the events leading up to the accident are unknown, said Jamieson, however SAPS were on the scene and will be investigating further. Drivers are urged to take alternative routes due to traffic. Robert Mckenzie of KZN EMS also warned motorist to drive with caution as the roads are slippery due to the wet weather conditions.
