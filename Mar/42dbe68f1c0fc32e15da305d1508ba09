A farm worker died on Tuesday morning after a trailer touched overhead power lines in Ixopo. Paramedics from Midlands EMS, who were called to a farm in Highflats at 9 am, said that when they arrived a tractor drawn trailer had been elevated to its full tipping position. “It was touching the overhead power lines,” a spokesperson for Midlands EMS said. “It appears that the operator was checking the lifting points and greasing them when the incident occurred.” The paramedics were unable to treat the man until Eskom had determined it was safe, and that the line had been isolated. “Sadly the patient had succumbed to his injuries,” the spokesperson said. “Our sincere condolences to the family of the deceased.”
