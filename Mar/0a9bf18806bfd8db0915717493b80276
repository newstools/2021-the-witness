A 55-year-old police captain from Umkomaas police station on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast was gunned down while travelling to work on Thursday morning. According SAPS spokesperson Colonel Brenda Muridili, the captain was driving a state vehicle near the Roseneath area in Umkomaas when he was attacked. She said he had been followed by a vehicle with four male occupants. Muridili explained that when the captain was at a speed hump, the occupants of the car vehicle opened fire on him. “He sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the body and was declared dead at the scene,” said Muridili, adding that high calibre firearms were used. Furthermore, Muridili said the suspects fled the scene in their getaway vehicle. “Umkomaas police officers that were busy conducting patrols in the area, spotted a vehicle that was travelling at a high speed and they gave chase,” said Muridili. She added that the suspect’s vehicle crashed into a truck whilst fleeing from the police officers which led to the assailants’ car catching fire. Muridili said the gunment thereafter robbed and killed a 33-year-old motorist in the vicinity. They then fled the scene in the victim’s car. “The police are still trying to follow all leads regarding the suspects. Charges of murder and carjacking have been opened for investigation at Umkomaas SAPS,” said Muridili. Muridili added that a 72-Hour Activation Plan has been implemented to “mobilise all the necessary resources to investigate this incident”. She said they are appealing to anyone who witnessed the attacks or anyone with information on the whereabouts of the attackers to call Crime Stop number 086 00 10111 or send tip-offs on the MySAPS App. “All information received will be treated with confidentiality,” said Muridili.
