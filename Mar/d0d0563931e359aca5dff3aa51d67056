As budget cuts threaten to affect the delivery of key services in KwaZulu-Natal, the provincial government plans to slash travel costs and freeze non-essential positions. Tabling the province’s budget during the legislature’s hybrid sitting on Tuesday, Finance MEC, Nomusa Dube-Ncube, said the low economic growth, which saw the KZN equitable share allocation being slashed by National Treasury, has made it difficult for the provincial government to continue funding non-critical programmes. The National Treasury cut the equitable share allocation by R335 million in the 2021/22 financial year. However, Dube-Ncube said the province’s financial position will be boosted by the fact that the treasury would be allocating more than a R1 billion to the province for the fight against Covid-19. As a result, the KZN government will not be dipping into its R370 million contingency reserve fund as yet. “Our contingency reserves remain intact,” she said. Despite the deteriorating financial situation, Dube-Ncube said the provincial government would not abandon its economic transformation programmes of supporting emerging businesses, the youth and women. “We will be allocating more to young people, particularly those in the digital economy,” she said.
