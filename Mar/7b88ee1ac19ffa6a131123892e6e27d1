The African National Congress (ANC) has announced that it
will on Tuesday, March 2, conduct a nationwide picket against ‘the scourge of
racism’ at eNCA offices and other centres. The ANC said the nationwide pickets at the eNCA offices
follows the widely publicised alleged racial conduct of eNCA journalist,
Lindsay Dentlinger, as well as the subsequent justification of such deplorable
conduct by the eNCA management. Dentlinge was accused of racism after she interviewed a
maskless white politician but asked a black politician to keep on his mask
while conducting interviews during the budget speech recently. eNCA came come out in defence of its reporter, saying that
her "alleged inconsistent behaviour" to Covid-19 protocols during a
live interview "was not racially motivated or with malicious intent". The ANC is planning to have their members picket outside the
eNCA offices across the country on Tuesday from 10 am to 12 pm. The party said
that in provinces where there are no eNCA offices, the pickets will take place
at Human Rights Commission offices or nearest police station.
