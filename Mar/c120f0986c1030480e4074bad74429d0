Pietermaritzburg motorcycle star Travis Teasdale turned the South African Cross Country Motorcycle Championship status quo on its head on Saturday when he rode his TT Racing Gas Gas to victory in a rough, tough and muddy Jolivet during the KwaZulu Natal season opener. The 24-year-old Open class rider Teasdale toppled the reigning champions Brad Cox of the OR2-winning Brother Leader Tread KTM team and OR1 rival Brett Swanepoel’s Rockstar Energy Husqvarna overall. “What a day!” reacted a delighted Teasdale. The Maritzburg-born rider defeated Cox by three and a half minutes, while Swanepoel was a further 37 seconds adrift. Another OR1 privateer, Scott Bouverie’s Gas Gas was fourth overall from Jarryd Coetzee’s Brother Leader Tread KTM and OR3 winner Davin Cocker on a Rockstar Energy Husqvarna. Teasdale took OR1 from Swanepoel, Bouverie and Coetzee, with D’art Lobjoit a fine fifth on the Pepson Plastics Kawasaki Motul team’s national debut and Hayden Louw sixth. Cox beat Ian Rall’s MCA Dragon Husqvarna in quarter-litre OR2, where Kerim Fitz-Gerald’s Red Bull KTM and Kyle Eggar on a Roost KTM were third and fourth.
