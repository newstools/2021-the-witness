Popular artist Rasta, whose real name is Lebani Sirenje, braved several threats from people on social media warning him not to attempt painting the late Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu. Rasta revealed the two portraits of the King on Thursday morning at the Kings memorial in Nongoma, KwaZulu-Natal. But to everyone’s surprise, the artworks were true masterpieces. Rasta has become famous for honouring deceased legends with
paintings, but many of his portraits have been criticised for looking nothing
like the intended people. After the King’s passing, Rasta was warned and even threatened
not to even think about painting or drawing a portrait of the King. Speaking to a News24 reporter, Rasta said he took the brave
decision to travel from Johannesburg to KZN despite there being people who were
threatening him to a point where he was afraid to come to KZN and showcase his
work. “I managed to say, ‘no this is what I do, this is what I
love, this is how I celebrate the legends who have passed on’. So, I was brave
enough to come here,” said Rasta. People on Twitter applauded Rasta’s work.
