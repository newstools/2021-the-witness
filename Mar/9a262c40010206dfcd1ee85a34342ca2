A fire in Mayville Code 2 township, near Durban, has left 16 families homeless. According to residents, the fire broke out on Thursday around 9 am, shortly after electricity came back following the two hour load shedding. “We suspect that maybe someone left their stove on before leaving for work and when the electricity came back, their shack caught fire,” said Sibongiseni Cele, a local landlord who rents out houses in Code 2. Residents said a total of 16 shacks were burnt down before emergency fire services arrived at scene and put out the fire. There were no reports of any death.
