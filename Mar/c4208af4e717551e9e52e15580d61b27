The entries for Sanlam Cape Town Marathon are set to open at midday on Wednesday as the organisers confirm the race will take place on Sunday, October 17. The organisers of Africa’s only World Athletics’ Gold Label status marathon will have a range of other races of varying distances on Saturday, October 16. Last year’s race was transformed into the inaugural Sanlam Cape Town Virtual Marathon, which introduced at least 15 000 runners from around the world to some of Cape Town’s best-loved landmarks via an interactive race app. This year, the marathon will revert to the well-known physical event with some great additions to the race and with Covid-19 precautions in place. There will be a first come, first served policy. Numbers allowed at events will be confirmed by local government and Athletics South Africa in the coming months, and those who enter but are unable to race due to the limits will be fully refunded.

Race director Renee Jordan said with seven months to go until the 2021 edition of the marathon, they are thrilled to officially open entries and continue planning for the event. “This time frame allows us to organise a world-class, prestigious event, while runners can use this time to fully prepare for the marathon,” said Jordan. “As we continue to navigate a pandemic, we want to assure all runners that they will receive a full refund if the event is not permitted to take place due to Covid restrictions.” The organisers anticipate the races will sell out and urge individuals to enter soon to secure a spot. The race ambassador Elana Meyer added that this has been a challenging time for many elite athletes who lost their income-earning potential in 2020, and that the prospect of these athletes returning to racing fills her with great excitement and joy.
