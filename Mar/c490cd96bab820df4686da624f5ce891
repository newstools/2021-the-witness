A body of a toddler was discovered in a wooded area near its home at KwaCeza in the Magagadolo area in Zululand. The 17-month-old child’s eyes had been gouged out. Her mother discovered the toddler was missing when she called her children to come into the house. The child was last seen playing with other children. In a separate incident, teenager, Lindelani Mavimbela, was tortured, beaten and left for dead at his home in the Elandslaagte area, near Ladysmith. Fifteen-year-old Lindelani was dragged out of his home in the Pepworthy/Kwasizwile area, in uThukela district, by his assailants. Lindelani’s attackers reportedly came to the house, demanding to see his uncle. When they couldn’t find him they attacked the teenager. His helpless grandmother collapsed and was helped by neighbours. KwaZulu-Natal Social Development MEC, Nonhlanhla Khoza, called on residents to provide law enforcement agencies with information that could lead to arrests of those involved in the murders. “We are a nation that has lost ubuntu,” she added. “To kill children like this indicates that the challenge we face as a society is huge. It is hard to believe that people can just snatch a little child to be killed like that. These heartless people have no place in our society.” Khoza called on local communities to work with the SAPS as they hunt for the killers. “These cruel people targeting defenceless children need to be found and exposed,” she added. “We need the community to help us to end the abuse and killing of children. “We strongly believe that the community can help the law enforcement agencies to crack these cases. All those responsible for child abuse and murders must never be left off the hook.” Teams of social workers have been dispatched to the two families to provide psycho-social support.
