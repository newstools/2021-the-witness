Pietermaritzburg police are searching for the people behind the death of a man who was gunned down while enjoying an evening at his local tavern. Sbonelo Ngubeni’s family has been left traumatised following his death on Saturday, February 27, at the Skapura Tavern in Mnqayi Road, Imbali Unit 2. Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson, Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese, said Ngubeni (42) was shot twice, on the head and in the chest. Another patron, a 38-year-old man, was injured in the incident, and Ngubeni’s pistol was taken by the killers. His aunt, Thokozani “Toh” Ngubeni, said she couldn’t understand who would have wanted to murder her nephew, who worked at the Msunduzi Municipality’s licensing department. “He was a very humble person ... he was kind and always took care of people,” she added. “We are very shocked.” The SAPS are investigating cases of murder, attempted murder, and theft.
