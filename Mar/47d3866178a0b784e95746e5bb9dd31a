A world-class 200 m line-up featuring the likes of Wayde van Niekerk , Akani Simbine and Anaso Jobodwana will headline the second ASA Athletix Invitational Meet at Ruimsig Athletics Stadium in Johannesburg on Tuesday. The men’s half-lap race, starting at 3 pm, will feature some of SA’s fastest men. Having won the 100 m contest at last week’s first leg of the ASA Athletix Invitational Meet, clocking 10,00 seconds with a tailwind, Commonwealth champion Simbine will turn out in the 200 m event for the first time this season. Long-time friend and rival Van Niekerk struggled into a headwind in his season opener at Potchefstroom last week, but the Olympic 400 m champion and world record holder will also be looking to showcase his form in the build-up to the ASA Senior Championships later next month. As he makes a return to the track, there will also be tremendous interest in former World Championships bronze medallist Anaso Jobodwana, who will be eager to make an impact. “We have a humdinger of a race in the 200 m and an overall super lineup in all events,” said Aleck Skhosana, ASA president.
