Pietermaritzburg residents and motorists were warned to stay clear of the Pietermaritzburg CBD and the N3 near the city on Thursday due to ongoing taxi protest between taxi operators from the Howick and Pietermaritzburg taxi associations over routes. Safe City Msunduzi reported that there have been several accidents on the N3 due to the taxi protest. Safe City said there was a taxi blockade on the N3 southbound at the Cedara interchange and ongoing taxi protest action outside the Department of Transport offices on Prince Alfred Street and Pietemaritz Street outside Department of Education offices. The protest started on Wednesday when taxi operators from the Howick taxi association filled the streets of Prince Alfred Street and barricaded the entrance to the Masukwane taxi rank in a standoff with Pietermaritzburg taxis over route disputes, causing severe traffic backlogs. On Thursday, Howick taxis could be seen on Prince Alfred Street where they have gathered once again to raise their concerns over the route disputes between them and Pietermaritzburg taxis. Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI) spokesperson, Zinhle Mali, said there were disruptions at Hilton earlier in the day but since then taxis have moved to Pietermaritzburg. Howick taxi members parked on the Howick offramp said they are not protesting but waiting for the outcome of the meeting at Prince Alfred Street to know whether the route issue will be resolved by Thursday. Police and traffic officials were seen monitoring the situation. Other residents who were in town said the city was in total chaos and the protest had caused traffic jams throughout the CBD. Commenting on Safe City Msunduzi’s Facebook page, a local said, “I was at Chase Valley Vets when the first batch of taxi's made their way down the highway. A law unto themselves unfortunately, should go back to buses.”
