A woman says she is grateful to have escaped uninjured after she and her 14-year-old niece were held at  knifepoint on Tuesday afternoon at the Cascades Mountain Bike Park, where they were robbed of their cameras. Setting out on a day to the park to teach her niece photography, the two women arrived at the park at 1 pm that afternoon and by 4 pm had packed up all their belongings but their cameras. “My niece wanted to go back onto the trail after we packed our car to take a few more pictures of the river and trees. I had a feeling it was unsafe as it was later in the day however, I agreed,” “Once we were halfway through the trail, I just had this feeling of uneasiness come over me and we then turned around to walk back,” said the woman, adding that on the route back they had to pass a bridge with bush on either side. The woman said they noticed two men approaching as they were walking on the bridge and hoped the men would be passing by. “In my head I just prayed and hoped they would pass us, and we would be able to continue to our car, but my heart stopped when they approached us and pulled out a knife,” said the woman. She said at that point all she could think about was the safety of her niece. The men demanded they hand over the cameras in their possession which the woman did and told the men they had nothing else. “The man grabbed my niece after we gave him our cameras and she screamed. I told him we had nothing else as we had packed our vehicle before this, so we were not lying,” “He asked for phones and only let my niece go when I showed him that we didn’t have anything and I then asked him, calmly to let her go. Thankfully he did,” said the woman. After five minutes of terror, the woman and her niece were freed and ran for their lives to the car where they gathered their thoughts and thereafter made their way home. Police confirmed a case docket was opened on Wednesday morning by the woman and investigations are ongoing.
