Police were on Thursday morning combing the scene after human bones were found by a resident in Peacevale, Pietermaritzburg, on Wednesday afternoon. David Dlamini told The Witness he was tending to a herd of sheep when he noticed a sandal nearby. “I went to inspect and immediately spotted some bones nearby and alerted the police,” said Dlamini. He said the police eventually came out to inspect what he saw and told him they would come back in the morning when it would be easier to see. Dlamini said this is the second incident reported in the area after they found other human remains in September. He said they managed to identify the previous body as a Mr Zondi's thanks to a card found on him. On Thursday search and rescue police officers found two femurs and a jaw bone upon further inspection. They are currently digging around the scene for the missing bone. *This is a developing story
