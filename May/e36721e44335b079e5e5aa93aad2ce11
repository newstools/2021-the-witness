Two men, Bongani Mkhwanazi (18) and Petruse Tsatsi (22), briefly appeared in the Colenso Magistrate court, on Thursday morning charged with the murder of wheelchair-bound farmer, 46 year-old Neil McKay. Mckay was found by his mother on the morning of April 10 at his farm at Winterton. The accused men were arrested early this week. Ladysmith Herald reports that they stood in the dock with heads bowed down during their appearance in court. Both asked to apply for legal aid. The case was remanded to June 3 for a bail application. Their names had not been released to Ladysmith Herald at the time of going to press. Neil Mckay’s body was found with strangulation marks. His hands were also tied and he was found still seated in his wheelchair. The farmer was disabled after being shot during an earlier farm attack some 20 years ago. His attackers were never caught.
