Church Street in Pietermaritzburg was abuzz on Wednesday as supporters of former president Jacob Zuma made their way to the High Court. Scores of people are currently outside the court singing struggle songs as they patiently wait for Zuma to address them after he appears in court. Several politicians have arrived including suspended ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule, former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede and current eThekwini Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda. Some family members of the former president have also arrived. His daughter Duduzile was seen arriving earlier. She was heckled by media and was escorted inside. Her twin Duduzane arrived heavily flanked by security and men in military uniform. Journalists were being pushed out of the way by the men who were guarding Duduzane. The former president’s corruption trial is expected to get underway on Wednesday morning. Zuma is charged along with French arms company Thales, on one count of racketeering, 12 of fraud, four of corruption and one of money laundering. The charges relate to 783 payments that Zuma allegedly received as a bribe to protect French arms company Thint - the local subsidiary of French arms company Thales - from an investigation into the controversial multi-billion rand arms deal. The alleged bribe was facilitated by Zuma’s former financial advisor Schabir Shaik. This is a developing story.
