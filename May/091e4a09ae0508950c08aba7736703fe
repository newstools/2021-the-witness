Megasen Roland Chetty (38) and Sarasvathi Belinda Pillay (47) appeared before the Durban Magistratesâ€™ Court on Friday charged with 14 counts of fraud, amounting to R900 000. Captain Nqobile Gwala, spokesperson for the SAPS, said the alleged fraud cases, committed between February 2018 and October 2019, targeted people living in Town Hill, Pietermaritzburg, as well as in Chatsworth, Phoenix, Malvern in the eThekwini Metro area and Tongaat on the north coast. The alleged scammers' modus operandi was to promise people discounted holidays both locally and abroad. The dockets were transferred to the provincial commercial crime investigation unit for further investigation. On the morning of May 28, Chetty and Pillay were arrested and appeared in court. They were each granted bail of R5 000 and the matter was remanded to July 7. Gwala appealed to other KZN residents who may have been victims of similar scams, to contact the investigating officer, Constable Durugiah, at 082 334 8454.
