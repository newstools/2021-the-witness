The first shoals of sardines were netted in Port Edward on the KZN South Coast on Monday. Greg Thompson, of the KZN Sharks Board, said the fishermen filled around 150 crates, which were sold at R1 500 a crate. “There were other nets laid but they were unsuccessful,” he added. “There were signs of other pockets of sardines seen heading north off Port Edward and Glenmore beach, close behind the backline.” Port Edward resident, Jessica Steyn, heard from a friend that they were netting sardines on Monday morning. “I love the sardine run so I went down to have a look,” she added. “I got there around 9.30 am this morning and they were already busy netting. “Some had come out of the water already and some boats were going out to net more. I could not purchase any because I don’t have cash at that moment.” The Sharks Board said there is a possibility the fish will get to Ramsgate and Margate within the next day or two, if sea conditions continue to be suitable. Thompson added: “Shark nets have been removed, drumlines neutralised, and bathing banned from Port Edward to Omentin.” Considered the planet’s greatest biomass migration, the event sees billions of silver sardines head northwards along the KZN South Coast. The shoals are concentrated near the surface of the water, close to shore, and attract a horde of marine predators from the land, skies and seas. Copper, dusky, blacktip and spinner sharks are joined by game fish like shad, garrick and geelbek. Dolphins and whales also feed on the sardines, driving them towards the surface where marine birds, including cormorants, gulls and terns, plummet from the skies into the water. Commercial fishermen also flock to the beaches, using nets to encircle the fish, which are then dragged ashore and scooped into baskets.
