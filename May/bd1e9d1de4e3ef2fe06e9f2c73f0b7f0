Ndondo received three life sentences for three counts of murder, 15 years for robbery, 15 years for unlawful possession of a firearm and three years for unlawful possession of ammunition. The judgement was handed down in the Pietermaritzburg High court on Friday. Police spokesperson captain Nqobile Gwala said the crimes were committed at midnight in April 2019. “Arnold Cassim was in his tuck-shop at Copesville when he was attacked by three unknown armed males. At gunpoint they took cash, cigarettes, airtime vouchers and cellphones. The victim was shot multiple times on the body and was declared at the scene,” said Gwala. Makoetjie and Tsiko both witnessed the crime and were later killed. Ndondo was arrested in Hannivile in Pietermaritzburg. “During his arrest, the accused was in possession of an illegal firearm with 15 rounds of ammunition. The recovered firearm was positively linked to all the three murders,” said Gwala. His accomplices Mfundo Zuma Sibisi (26) and Zain Khwashube (34) were also traced and arrested at Hanniville in 2019. Sibisi was sentenced to 25 years for murder of Cassim and 20 years each for other two counts of murder. The sentences were to run concurrently. The case against Zain Mkhwashube is still pending at High court. He is expected to appear before the Pietermaritzburg court on Monday.
