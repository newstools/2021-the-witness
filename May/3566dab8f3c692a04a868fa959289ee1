The ANC National Working Committees (NWC) has resolved that party members facing criminal charges but have not yet stepped down as per the organisation’s step aside guidelines should be suspended. “The NWC resolved that the decision of the last NEC, as outlined above, must be implemented. Those who have been charged with corruption or other serious crimes and who have not stepped aside should be suspended in terms of Rule 25.70 of the ANC Constitution,” the ANC NWC said in a statement issued on Tuesday following its meeting on Monday. The ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) gave party members facing criminal charges until April 30 to vacate both their government and party positions. However, the deadline was extended pending the ANC NWC’s deliberations on the matter. High profile ANC members affected by the party’s NEC directive includes its secretary general, Ace Magashule, former eThekwini Mayor, Zandile Gumede and ANC provincial deputy chairperson, Mike Mabuyakhul.
