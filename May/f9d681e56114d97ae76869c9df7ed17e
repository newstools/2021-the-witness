Pietermaritzburg residents banded together outside the Pietermaritzburg legislature on Wednesday to protest against the recent violence against Palestinians at the al-Asqa Mosque area and in different parts of Palestine. Speaking on behalf of the protestors, Mohammed Saeed said it was his and others responsibility to stand against oppression. “As those who have experienced apartheid it is incumbent on South Africans to play a leading role globally to ensure Israel is treated as a pariah state by the international community, facing full economic sanctions, boycott and an arms embargo. “If South Africa is serious about confronting all forms of discrimination, racism and violence then the government must act now and take a firm stand to end these injustices against the Palestinian people,” said Saeed. Saeed handed over a memorandum to the legislature raising their concerns as well as suggestions and recommendations for how South Africa should proceed in regard to Israel.
