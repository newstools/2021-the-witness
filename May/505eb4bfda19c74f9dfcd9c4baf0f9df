Get the candles and gas lamps out. Eskom is implementing stage two loadshedding from 4 pm on Monday to 5 am on Tuesday. The power utility has also warned that further power cuts are probable for the rest of the week. In a statement Eskom said: "Loadshedding has been caused by the higher demand as a result of the cold front setting in much earlier than expected, as well as high breakdowns of generation units. "The general supply constraints will persist throughout the high winter demand period, which increases the likelihood of loadshedding." The breakdown of power generation units has resulted in a loss of 14 560MW of capacity, while another 2 300MW is unavailable due to planned maintenance. "Some generation units are expected to return to service, starting this evening, which will help ease the strain," according to Eskom's statement. "This is, however, mot sufficient to eliminate the high probability of loadshedding for the rest of the week."
