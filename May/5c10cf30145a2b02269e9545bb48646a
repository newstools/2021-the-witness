Talent Mncube (19), who was previously arrested for murder, attempted murder and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, was rearrested in Pietermaritzburg on Monday after he had escaped from police custody last week. Mncube is part of the 45 awaiting trial prisoners who were being transported from New Prison to the Pietermaritzburg Magistrates Court when armed gunmen forced the police truck transporting prisoners off the road. On the same afternoon, 27 of the 45 prisoners were back in police custody while 18 were confirmed to be on the run. On Thursday morning, two more were rearrested. Thubelihle Dlomo (19), who was previously arrested for murder, was rearrested on Friday morning at KwaDukuza. The number of those still on the run now sits at 14 after Mncube’s arrest. Police spokesperson, Brigadier Jay Naicker, said Mncube will have an additional charge of escaping from lawful custody added to his charge sheet. “We are still tracking the movements of the remaining 14 awaiting trail prisoners that are still on the run,” said Naicker. He urged anyone who may have information on their whereabouts is requested to contact Brigadier Hlongwane 079 684 9114 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
