Former president Jacob Zuma’s corruption trial got underway in the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Wednesday morning with him pleading not guilty to all the charges. Zuma has decided not to disclose his defence at this stage. He is charged along with French arms company Thales on one count of racketeering, 12 of fraud, four of corruption and money laundering. Thales has also pleaded not guilty. The charges relate to 783 payments which Zuma allegedly received as a bribe to protect French arms company‚ Thint (the local subsidiary of French arms company Thales)‚ from an investigation into the controversial multi-billion rand arms deal. The alleged bribe was allegedly facilitated by Zuma’s former financial adviser‚ Schabir Shaik. Zuma has brought a ‘special plea’ for state advocate, Billy Downer, SC, to be removed as the prosecutor. Zuma’s trial was adjourned to July 19. The state needs to
prepare its reply to Zuma's ‘special plea’ to have Downer removed as the
prosecutor. This is because the state needs time to respond to this plea. The case is proceeding.
