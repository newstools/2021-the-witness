Former president Jacob Zuma's trial has now been adjourned to May 26 in the Pietermaritzburg High Court. On that date, the indictment is expected to be put to him and he will plead not guilty. Zuma's legal team, led by advocate Thabani Masuku, SC, indicated it would be bringing an application for state advocate Billy Downer, SC, to be recused. Papers will be served on the state on Wednesday this week. The application will likely be heard next week, on the date the trial has been adjourned to. Zuma is accused of receiving an annual bribe of R500,000 from French arms dealer Thales in exchange for protection from an investigation into the controversial arms deal. The alleged bribe was allegedly facilitated by Schabir Shaik, who was Zuma’s former financial adviser.  Zuma’s supporters who had gathered outside the court on Monday included members of the Mkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) and ANC members who are part of the party's radical economic transformation (RET) faction. Suspended ANC secretary general, Ace Magashule, is also expected to address the crowd. Zuma's son, Duduzane Zuma, was also at the Freedom Park outside the High Court, where Zuma appeared.
