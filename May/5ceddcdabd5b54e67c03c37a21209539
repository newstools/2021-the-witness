A group of students are walking from Durban to Pretoria to raise money and awareness around issues faced by those who want to further their studies. Thandolwethi Dlanga, a postgraduate student at the University of Pretoria and chairperson of Walk4Access, told The Witness that through their efforts they hoped to help students from poor backgrounds with fees, accommodation, food and paying off historical debt. Many students, he said, had been unable to continue with their degrees because their parents had lost their jobs or businesses. “This is also a walk of hope,” Dlanga. “Because of Covid-19 people have lost so much and we want to tell them that beyond the pandemic there is hope.” The 10 students, who study at the University of Pretoria, Tshwane University of Technology, North West University and Unisa, began their walk at Durban Girls’ High School.

They should not be restricted just because they are girls,” he added.
