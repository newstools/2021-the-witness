The Long March 5B rocket is set to crashland on the Earth's surface tomorrow, but no one knows yet where it will land. Sky News is reporting that the rocket was launched from the Wenchang Space Launch Centre on April 29 to carry the first module of China's future space station into orbit. The remnants of the rocket will return to Earth this weekend. The re-entry into the atmosphere is imminent and is uncontrolled, said Sky News. The US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said there are no plans to shoot the rocket down. He's reported as having said they are "hopeful" the debris will not harm anyone and hope it will "land in a place where  it won't harm anyone". The body of the rocket is circling the Earth at a speed of 27 600 km/h. The place where it will re-enter the earth's atmosphere "cannot be pinpointed until within hours of its re-entry", which is projected to happen on Saturday.
