The eSwatini royal family on Friday urged the Zulu royal family to protect the children of the late regent of the Zulu nation, Queen Dlamini Zulu. Speaking during the memorial service of Queen Dlamini Zulu at the Khangela Royal Palace in Nongoma, Prince Guduza Dlamini, said the Queen’s children were still in KwaZulu-Natal. “Yes, the Queen is gone, but she has left behind her children. “As the eSwatini royal family we are confident that the children will continue receiving good care,” he said. There have been rumours that the Queen fell ill after being poisoned about two years ago. There is currently a dispute within the Zulu Royal Family on how the estate of the late Zulu King, Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu should be distributed among his wives and children. Among those attending the memorial service include KZN Premier, Sihle Zikalala, former president, Jacob Zuma and health minister, Zweli Mkhize.
