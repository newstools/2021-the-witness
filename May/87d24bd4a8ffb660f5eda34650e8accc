Premier of KwaZulu-Natal, Sihle Zikalala, has called on the people of KwaZulu-Natal to adhere to the newly announced Covid-19 restrictions to avoid the province entering the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. “We welcome the decision by President Cyril Ramaphosa to move the country into adjusted level two as a sign that our government is caring and values the lives of our citizens," he said on Monday. "As stated by the President, these decisions are based on medical and scientific advice, and the need to prevent our country from descending into a disaster “As of yesterday, KZN had 137 new cases, which brings the total number of Covid–19 cases in the province to 339 811. "While we are not in the third wave (as defined) as yet as a province, we have been seeing a steady rise in numbers in the past week. "On Saturday, we had 160 new cases. Again, on Friday, the number of new cases stood at 135, and on Thursday, we had 150. But if you go back just a few weeks, to May 3, you will see that we only had 65 new cases. So, the numbers have been fluctuating. "Sadly, our province has, to date, lost 10 510 people to this deadly virus. We are therefore, once again, urging our people to adhere to all the safety precautions." Zikalala said the latest move is a critical balancing act by government which intends to save lives, while at the same time having to make the choice to protect the economy and livelihoods. “The economy must be assisted to recover, but we must also contain the spread. We will use the level two adjusted strategy to accelerate vaccination roll-out," he added. "The province will be focused this week on the elderly and all those who qualify for vaccination at this point. We are taking proactive steps to react faster so that we save lives”.
