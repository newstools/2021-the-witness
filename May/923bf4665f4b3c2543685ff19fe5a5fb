A 59-year-old woman and former bookkeeper at a Dundee firm, Charmaine Koch has been sentenced to eight years imprisonment after she pleaded guilty in the Durban Specialised Commercial Crimes Court to 235 counts of fraud totaling about R2.7 million. Regional spokesperson for the KZN Director of Public Prosecutions, Natasha Kara said in a statement Koch worked for Dundee-based company, Glendee Fertilizer and Lime CC. “Her job entailed administrative work, bookkeeping and uploading creditor payments with supporting invoices onto the company’s online banking profile. She would then prepare a schedule of the creditors that needed to be paid, which was then submitted to her manager who logged onto the system and released the payments. “At some point, Koch experienced financial difficulties with her and her husband’s salary insufficient to support their family. She decided to defraud her employer and changed the banking details of various creditors to her own banking details. “ She also used previous creditors invoices and created new ones which she submitted with her details for payment. The money went directly into her bank account. She did this from August 2012 to January 2017. “In February 2017, after returning from a holiday with her husband, she was advised that her employer had opened a fraud case against her. She did not return to work and was eventually arrested and taken to court.” Kara said the case was successfully prosecuted by Senior State Advocate, Ashika Haripersad. The NPA welcomed the successful prosecution. The Director of Public Prosecutions in KwaZulu-Natal, Advocate Elaine Zungu said, “The accused in this matter was placed in a position of trust yet she abused this trust and decided to defraud her employer for five years. We hope that sentences of this nature are indicative of the NPA’s stance against these types of cases.”
