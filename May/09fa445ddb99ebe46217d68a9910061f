If you have a smartphone and have access to WhatsApp you will be able to register for the government’s Covid-19 vaccine scheme. Use of the social media network is part of the national department of health’s online registration system. Health Minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize, said the electronic vaccination data system (EVDS) is available to everyone in the country and can be accessed via the Internet, a cellphone USSD or through Whats­App. “The President, myself, hundreds of thousands of healthcare workers and now you, the citizens of South Africa, have or will all have access to the vaccines through the same process, by using this system,” Mkhize added. “The quality of services will be the same for all of us and the system will assign a vaccination site closest to our homes or where we work and not based on whether a particular site is a public or private facility.” ALSO READ | Health department must use social media to convey vaccination messages. “If you are unable to register by these methods, you may simply go to the nearest vaccination centre and we will register you on the spot.
