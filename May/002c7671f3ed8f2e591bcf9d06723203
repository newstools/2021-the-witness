Pietermaritzburg optometry graduate Zaakirah Moola wants to help the less fortunate get the best eye care possible. “This is a dream come true,” said Moola, who has graduated from the University of KwaZulu-Natal with a Bachelor of Optometry summa cum laude. Moola believes that anyone can achieve good results with hard work and dedication and hopes to expand her knowledge in the field of low vision and eye care for the elderly. “My goal is to set up eye clinics for the less privileged so that they can receive the best eye care possible,” she said. “My family members were challenged with extremely weak eyesight. Witnessing their struggles while being unable to understand why, sparked my interest in studying optometry.” The Covid-19 pandemic in her final year caused major disruptions as she couldn’t attend class, but she remained positive and spent time researching the more difficult concepts. Moola believes it is inevitable that every student will be challenged during the course of their studies. “During trying moments, I prayed and constantly reminded myself that God [Allah] will help me get through it. My motto is ‘Always let your faith be stronger than your fear’. My parents’ support helped me overcome my obstacles. They always motivated me to do the best I can in any situation.” She studied at the Westville campus and now works in her hometown of Pietermaritzburg.
