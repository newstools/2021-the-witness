Women make up 68% of this year’s top achievers who will graduate at the 2021 University of KwaZulu-Natal Autumn virtual graduation ceremonies. Of the 10 313 graduands being awarded degrees and diplomas 382 will graduate cum laude and 149 summa cum laude. The virtual graduation ceremonies, all starting at 11 am, will be broadcast by the university between Tuesday and May 28 starting with the College of Agriculture, Engineering and Science, followed by the College of Health Sciences, College of Humanities, and lastly, the College of Law and Management Studies. Degrees will be conferred on graduands who have succeeded in fulfilling relevant academic requirements and whose names appear on the graduation programme, including those whose qualifications are being awarded posthumously. Acting executive director of UKZN’s corporate relations division, Normah Zondo said: “The university had hoped that by 2021, we would be able to hold our graduation celebrations the traditional way. “Unfortunately, due to the unprecedented challenges brought about by Covid-19, the university has had once again to change significantly the manner in which it confers qualifications and distributes its degree and diploma certificates. As one of the largest universities in the country, this is an enormous undertaking.” READ | Virtual events for UKZN graduates Zondo says the university will confer 7 399 undergraduate degrees and 2 914 postgraduate degrees, of which 362 are master’s (thesis) qualifications and 257 doctoral degrees.
