Angry parents from Dalton, KwaZulu-Natal, protested outside Cool Air Secondary on Monday morning demanding the removal of the principal from the school. The fed-up parents locked the school gate disrupting teaching and learning as classes could continue as normal. A small group of pupils also gathered near the protesting crowd. The parents are accusing the principal of withholding reports cards of the pupils who have not paid their school fees, mismanaging the school's funds and excluding parents from school meetings. This is a developing story.
