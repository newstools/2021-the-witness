A KwaZulu-Natal fisherman was left seriously injured after
he was pulled into the sea by a fish he was trying to catch at High Rock in
Chakas Rock. IPSS Medical Rescues said the incident happened early on Saturday. They said they received reports of a fisherman in progress
of drowning. When they arrived, it was established that a fisherman had
hooked a fish and was in the process of landing the catch, when a wave knocked
the man and swept him off the rocks and into the sea. IPSS said a fellow fisherman rushed to the manâ€™s aid and
managed to get him back onto the rocks. Unfortunately, the fisherman had
already suffered serious injuries. He was taken to a local medical facility. IPSS hailed the fellow fisherman who did a great job in
rescuing the man.
