In what was described as a minute heist by eye-witnesses, the Truro Plaza Post Office, in Pietermaritzburg, was robbed by three armed men on Tuesday morning. According to those in the building when the robbery took place, three men made their way into the Post Office where they brandished their guns, commanding everyone inside the building to get on the floor as they ransacked the safe and took everything in it. “I was inside when it happened. As soon as I saw the gun pointed at the teller I immediately tried to turn back and leave upon which one of the men asked me where I was going and made me drop to the ground and lay flat,” said an elderly man who asked to not to be named. The man said it was over in a matter of seconds after the robbers instructed all in the building to get on the floor. “It happened so fast you didn’t even get time to register it all. Two men went into the back and one waited at the front of the tellers and then they were gone just like that,” said the man. Police said there were six robbers, three were inside the Post Office and three waited outside. They drove off in a white vehicle. Police also confirmed that a case of robbery has been opened. The robbers did not open fire and no one was injured.
