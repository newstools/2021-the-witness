A driver and his passenger were killed after their car
rolled over on the M4 near the Simbithi Eco-Estate in Ballito, North of Durban,
on Sunday morning. Shawn Herbst, Netcare 911 spokesperson, said reports
indicate that the driver of the car lost control resulting in a rollover,
crashing through the safety barrier, leaving the road and slamming into a tree
down an embankment. The car that was only being kept in place by a few small
branches was stabilised using a cable by Big Show Towing, allowing crews to
assess the scene, said Herbst. He said one man had been ejected from the car during the
rollover and was found by the eThekwini Fire and Rescue Services in the bushes
further away. In a separate accident, one woman was killed on Saturday
afternoon after a taxi carrying 15 passengers lost control and rolled over
repeatedly at Maqongqo, also known as Table Mountain, in Pietermaritzburg. Police spokesperson, sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese, told The
Witness that the other passengers were all transported to various nearby
hospitals. “We are investigating a case of reckless and negligent
driving along with culpable homicide in regards to the matter and no arrests
have been made yet,” said Ngobese. In another incident, a man was left critically injured after
he was knocked down by a car on Dr Chota Motala Road in Pietermaritzburg on
Sunday night. Mi7 said their Special Threat Response Unit found the pedestrian,
estimated to be about 25 years old, in a critical condition lying on the road. He was taken to a nearby hospital. Mi7 said the police were
on scene to investigate the cause of the accident.
