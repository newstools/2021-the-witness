A man died while another was left injured after a industrial explosion at a cleaning company Cliffdale. ER24 multimedia producer Ross Campbell said it was alleged that the small explosion inside a tanker happened while a man was inside. “The injured patient is believed to have attempted to rescue the man but was overcome by carbon monoxide. “ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene at 10.15 am along with the Fire Department. The 40-year-old male was found to have suffered moderate to serious injuries and was treated and transported to a private hospital in Hillcrest,” said Campbell. Campbell said the man's body was being recovered at the time of the report. Police were also on the scene for further investigation.
