Sisulu said for the coming financial year, the department has prioritised various projects, including raising the wall of Hazelmere Dam to increase its 19,38 million cubic metre capacity. The implementation of such projects come amid the minimal decline of dam levels in KZN from last week’s 73,8% to 73,6%. During a similar period in 2020, the provincial storage capacity stood at 63,4%. “The plan is to speedily and effectively implement bulk water projects so as to ensure water security to affected communities,” said the department’s spokesperson, Sputnik Ratau. He added that the department has identified severely affected districts such as Ugu District, which continues to experience inconsistent water challenges. Ratau said during the tabling of the budget vote that Sisulu acknowledged that water challenges in Ugu were unnecessary and should be resolved. “It is for this reason that we are working around the clock to speedily implement water projects as dam levels are expected to decline in the coming weeks,” Ratau said. Meanwhile, the Umgeni Water Supply System this week stands at 85,5% from 85,9% last week. Midmar Dam is at 99% from 100,1%, Nagle Dam is down from 90,4% to 89,3%, Albert Falls Dam is at 56% from 55,5% and Inanda Dam is at 98,7%, down from 99,3%.
