Entries for the 2021 Kwanalu Young Farmer of the Year competition have opened. The annual contest will see the most promising young farmers from all nine provinces compete for the coveted title and drive away in a Toyota Hilux single cab, among other prizes. Chief executive officer of Kwanalu, Sandy La Marque, said the competition highlights the skills and entrepreneurial spirit needed to be a successful farmer. “We know we are blessed with a very high calibre of farmers in our province but this competition is more than just how much a farmer is able to produce or how pretty their farm looks. It’s about sound business acumen and strong agricultural practices among a whole range of other criteria.” The judging and evaluation of the farmers and their agricultural practices, takes place at provincial level with the applicants being evaluated on all aspects of their business including their overall vision for the future of their farm/ business, she said. “We encourage all of our eligible members under 40 years old to enter this competition recognising the great skill and entrepreneurial spirit we have here in KZN,” said La Marque.
