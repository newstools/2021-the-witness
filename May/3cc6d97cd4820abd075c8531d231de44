Less than two weeks after parents from Cool Air locked the gate of Cool Air Secondary School in Dalton, another protest erupted on Thursday morning with parents and pupils burning tyres and demanding answers from the KZN Department of Education. The angry parents are demanding that the department remove school principal Mandla Phungula from the school. Protesters also accused the department of making empty promises. In a memorandum handed over to the representatives of the department on May 17, parents gave the department seven days to respond to their concerns. Parents claim that they have not received any response from the department. Last week, spokesperson for the KZN Department of Education Muzi Mahlambi said an investigation was conducted in respect of the issues that parents have raised and found to have no substance. "Unfortunately, it is some members of the very same SGB that are disturbing the school. We intend have action taken against them with a view to make a recommendation for their dissolution. This is more of a political game than the alleged mismanagement," Mahlambi said. Teaching and learningÂ  at the school is currently at a standstill. A small group of pupils also joined in the protest outside the school on Thursday. Dalton police are currently at the scene to monitor the situation. This is a developing story.
