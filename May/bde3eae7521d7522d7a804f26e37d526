The bodies of three fishermen were recovered on Saturday after they were attacked by a hippo at the Pongolapoort Dam in Jozini. SAPS KZN spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said the men had been placing their gill nets, using a home made raft, at around 4 pm on Wednesday when the attack happened. In terms of regulation 19 of the Marine Living Resources Act (18 of 1998 ) and section 150 (2) of Nature Conservation Ordinance 15 of 1974, it is illegal to use gill nets, according to KZN Ezemvelo Wildlife. These nets typically allow fish to get only their heads through the netting but not their body. Their gills get caught in the mesh as the fish tries to back out of the net. As the fish struggles to free itself, it becomes more and more entangled. Officers from the Empangeni search and rescue unit, together with members from the operational response service at Richards Bay, joined forces to conduct vessel patrols, but they were unable to locate the bodies of the men until Saturday. An inquest docket has been opened with the Ingwavuma SAPS.
