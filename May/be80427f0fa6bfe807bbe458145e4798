An Ulundi funeral parlour owner was arrested after being
found with a suspected stolen coffin and other burial items. Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, said on
Saturday, Ulundi detectives together with visible policing members arrested a
50-year-old man for possession of suspected stolen property. Mbele said a manager of a funeral parlour in Ulundi told the
police that on Thursday, May 13, a known man owning another funeral parlour
came to her office and requested to buy a dome type coffin on discount, but his
request was denied. “On the following day in the morning, on arrival at the
office the complainant discovered that the storeroom was broken into. She
discovered that the dome coffin, green runner and two grave anchor crosses were
missing,” said Mbele. She said a case was opened at Ulundi police station for
further investigation. After intensive investigation, Mbele said the stolen items
were recovered at the 50-year-old man’s offices and he was immediately arrested. The man is expected to appear in court on Monday, May 17, facing
possession of suspected stolen property charges.
