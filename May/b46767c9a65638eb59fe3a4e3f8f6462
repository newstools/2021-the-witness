A man (58) who spent more than 12 hours on a cliff in the Ezindlovini area at Oakford near Verulam was rescued on Tuesday afternoon. North Coast emergency service, Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) received calls from community members on Tuesday morning requesting assistance. On arrival the RUSA members managed to speak to the man, who could not be seen as he was blocked by vegetation and was physically unreachable at that point. RUSA spokesperson, Prem Balram said: “The man explained that he was injured and was stuck in a bush on the face of the cliff.” He said rescue technicians from the SAPS K9 Search & Rescue Unit and Emer-G-Med arrived on scene and were in the process of abseiling down the cliff when the man managed to free himself and slide down to a stream at the base of the cliff. He was then helped by members of the community. Balram said it was later established that the man had been drinking alcohol on Monday at about 11 pm, when he slipped while walking along the embankment above the cliff. He did not suffer any serious injuries but was transported to hospital by ambulance.
