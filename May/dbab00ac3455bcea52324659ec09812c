Members of the public on Thursday continued to stream in at the KwaKhangela Royal Palace, in Nongoma, to pay their last respects to the late regent of the Zulu nation, Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu, who passed on last week. Some mourners, who came from as far as her country of birth eSwatini, could be seen in their Swazi traditional attires called emihiya. Queen Dlamini Zulu died at Johannesburg 's Milpark Hospital. She was buried during a private ceremony on Thursday at an undisclosed burial site in Nongoma. Izintombi, Amabutho and Zulu women's regiments know as Isiphithiphithi also came in large numbers. Sounds of Zulu traditional songs that are commonly sang during funerals and wars rang across the palace as they danced on the lawns. A memorial service for the late Queen Dlamini Zulu, who was granted a special funeral by President Cyril Ramaphosa, will be held on Friday at the KwaKhangela Palace.
