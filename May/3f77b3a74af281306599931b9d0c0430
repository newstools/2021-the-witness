The African National Congress (ANC) in Kwazulu-Natal has come out against the proposed polyandry regulation saying it does nothing to improve the conditions of the lives of woman in the country. This was revealed by Mdumiseni Ntuli, ANC KZN Provincial Secretary, during a media briefing on Tuesday. Ntuli was giving a report on the provincial executive committee's (PEC) decisions which met on Monday. “The PEC is convinced that there are no rational or cultural imperatives intended by the introduction of practice of polyandry as one of the aspects of the marriage bill,” said Ntuli. Last month the Department of Home Affairs published a green paper on marriages for public comment which seeks to develop a new single marriage bill. Among things like the ban of child marriages, the bill proposes the legalisation of polyandry to allow South African women to marry more than one person. Ntuli said the discussion of polyandry was a “diversion” from the real issues are faced by women in the country such as patriarchy, abuse and non-equal pay. “Women are not concerned about getting multiple husbands, they are concerned about being part of the economy in the country,” he said. Ntuli said the PEC's opposition to polyandry should not be misconstrued as support for polygamy, which is legal in SA. "Let's deal with the virtue of being African women and as a class," he said According to the green paper, the Department Home Affairs hopes to submit the bill for a vote in parliament by 2024.
