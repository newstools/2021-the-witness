A 12-year-old boy was buried at the weekend after being run over by a vehicle allegedly belonging to the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. The incident took place on the R617 in Mpophomeni, in the KZN Midlands on Monday last week. Agriculture and rural development MEC Bongiwe Moloi-Sithole said the employee involved in the accident has been suspended from work pending an internal investigation to ascertain what happened during the accident. She said the department will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that the employee involved is brought to book if found guilty. She has also made a call to state vehicle drivers to obey the rules and to be extra cautious when driving on public roads. Moloi-Sithole said the process of providing counselling to the boyâ€™s family and his friends has begun. She said a team, comprising of senior officials from the department of social development and agriculture and rural development on Tuesday visited the Ngqulunga home to offer condolences and assistance to the grieving family. The team first visited the home on Thursday last week. MEC Sithole-Moloi said it was agreed that the departments would continue to provide psychological counselling and other social relief packages for the family.
