Glenwood and Tamboville residents barricaded the entrance to Glenwood from as early as 3am on Wednesday in protests over housing and service delivery in the area. Burning tree branches and tyres were used to block the access roads as the angry residents refused to allow cars to go and out of the area. The residents said they would continue protesting until they were given an audience with Msunduzi's Mayor Mzimkhulu Thebolla. Speaking to The Witness, Sihle Gwamanda said they were tired of being overlooked for new housing projects while MK Vets and former soldiers continued to be given preference over residents. “For the last two years now we have seen these MK Vets moving into new low cost houses while we continue to be squashed with our extended families in our small houses. “We are tired and angry. The municipality has been promising us housing since 1994 and still we are all without housing while these supposed MK Vets continue to receive new housing in front of our eyes,” said Gwamanda. Police are currently on scene to ensure the protest does not escalate to violence. *This is a developing story
