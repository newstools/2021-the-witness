Sharks coach Sean Everitt on Thursday made only one change to his starting line-up for the all-important Rainbow Cup clash with the Bulls on Saturday. The two sides are set for an entertaining top-of-the-table duel at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria at 6.15 pm. Both teams are unbeaten in the competition after two rounds. Young scrumhalf Jaden Hendrikse is the only change in the Sharks starting XV as he replaces Grant Williams, who is not in the matchday squad. Another young scrumhalf, Sanele Nohamba, is back in the reckoning and set to play off the bench. Nohamba didnâ€™t crack the nod for the clash against the Lions last weekend. Lukhanyo Am will captain the coastal team in Pretoria as usual. In the new competition, the Sharks have claimed victories against the Stormers away and Lions at home over the past two weeks. Both the Lions and Stormers are still winless in the competition, as they also lost to the Bulls.
