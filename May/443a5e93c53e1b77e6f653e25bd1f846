A group of traditional healers and the clergy in KwaZulu-Natal have pledged their support for former president Jacob Zuma. While the court proceedings continued inside the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Wednesday, the two groups told The Witness that the aim of their attending the day’s proceedings was to bring peace within the ANC and also support a member of the community who is in need. Bishop Sandile Innocent Ndlela of the Methodist Church of South Africa in KwaMashu said they wanted to offer support and counselling to Zuma. Ndlela said the court process was taking a toll on Zuma emotionally and physically. “As pastors we are here to pray, we are also here because we want the court process to be fair. “It is not for us to say whether he is guilty or not, the courts will make a ruling on that,” said Ndlela. Ndlela said they could see that Zuma was in pain. “The former president should be at home with his family not attending a court case. We visited him at his home in Nkandla and he told us that he was in physical and emotional pain as a result of this,” said Ndlela. The traditional healers said it was their role to provide support to members of the community who needed it. Representing the Traditional Health Practitioner’s Association of South Africa in KwaZulu-Natal Mshanelo Komo said, “As traditional healers our role is to help the community. Former president Jacob Zuma is a member of the community. He has told us that he is innocent, and we believe him.”
