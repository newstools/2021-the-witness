The National Prosecuting Authority announced on Wednesday that it has appointed four advocates to deal with former president Jacob Zuma’s special plea application to have state advocate, Billy Downer, SC, removed as the prosecutor. Its national spokesperson Sipho Ngwenya said that advocates Wim Trengove, Andrew Breitenbach, Hephzibah Rajah and Ncumisa Mayosi have been appointed and “effectively given a delegation in terms of the NPA Act to be prosecutors in this matter”. Meanwhile, Zuma on Wednesday pleaded not guilty to charges of corruption, racketeering, fraud and money laundering linked to the multibillion-rand arms deal. He also brought the special plea application. In it, he said that if it is successful then, “I am entitled to be acquitted”. The application has been adjourned to July 19, when the case resumes.
