Four firearms were recovered by police in the Plessislaer policing precinct, near Pietermaritzburg in KwaZulu-Natal, on Tuesday. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said police officers are continuing to clean the province by removing illegal firearms in communities. Mbele said the team deployed in Pietermaritzburg is working tirelessly to keep the Plessislaer and surrounding areas a crime free zone. She said this is demonstrated by the firearms recovered by the Pietermaritzburg Flying Squad police who were conducting crime prevention duties at Sweetwaters, in the Khohlwa area in the Plessislaer policing precinct on Tuesday. The police went to a homestead after receiving information about illegal firearms. “The search was conducted at the homestead and three rifles and a shotgun were seized. A total of 288 rounds of ammunition and three magazines were recovered." Mbele said investigations revealed that the firearms belonged to owner of the house who had died. Mbele said all firearms will be taken for a ballistic test to see if they were used to commit any crimes in the country. “We are appealing to community members who are in possession of deceased’s firearms to make sure that they hand over those firearms to the police. Those who wish to apply for a license to possess such firearms should contact their local police,” said Mbele.
