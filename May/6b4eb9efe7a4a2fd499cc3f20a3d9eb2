A R1,5 billion investment in logistics operations was launched in Hammarsdale on Tuesday which is set to boost the province’s economic recovery and job creation efforts. Situated alongside the N3, at the new Hammarsdale Interchange, it will help to alleviate truck congestion in the port of Durban, said Premier Sihle Zikalala at the launch. The logistics facility by Pepkor, is located at Keystone Business Park, and is expected to employ 2 200 staff once completed. “The logistical and supply chain facility is strategically a value-adding investment in the province because it will assist in reducing the congestion at the port of Durban. The pleasing aspect of this investment is that a private sector company took advantage of the available town planning and spatial development opportunities created by government,” he said.

Bidvest and Portnet have committed to bringing 6 000 trucks to stay in the park, thus decongesting the port of Durban, he said. He added that a logistics and supply chain facility like Pepkor’s, will place Hammarsdale as one of the towns poised to be a destination for superior logistics and supply chain investment because technology and systems are deployed to cement innovation in the movement of stock, goods and services.
