Motorists using the Curry’s Post Road have been given a smoother ride, thanks to local resident, Jonty Myhill. Fed up with trying to dodge potholes on the road, between Howick and Curry’s Post Road, in the KZN Midlands, he has hired a team of workers to fill them - not for the first time. "It's the third time that I'm doing it," he said. "Three years ago we filled the potholes extensively and then a few months later we did a few more. "No-one else is doing it. In the end you just have to put your hand in your pocket and do it yourself." Myhill, who is using his own money to buy materials, also used put up a sign to send a message to uMngeni Municipality, who have done little to repair the road. It read: “Slow please! Ratepayers repairing the roads because the municipality is bloody useless.” Photos of the sign spread quickly on social media, with users of WhatsApp and Facebook praising him for his efforts. Myhill said he had no desire to get involved in an argument with the municipality, but was sick and tired of trying to avoid potholes and putting his life and that of his family in danger. "It's only a matter of time before someone gets injured or killed," he added. Following a meeting of the Curry's Post Conservancy on Tuesday night to discuss the pothole problem, Myhill has agreed to suspend work for today to allow the committee to draft legal documents. He and his team plan to be back at work on Thursday.
