On the other hand, Queen Dlamini has made a separate application demanding a 50% share of the late Zulu King’s estate. During Friday’s court proceedings there was a tussle between the applicant’s lawyers, advocate Ndumiso Xulu and Advocate Griffiths Madonsela, who is representing the new King and the kwaKhangela Royal Palace.

However, Advocate Madonsela argued that the matter should be struck off the roll to allow parties to file additional affidavits.
