Members of Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) are currently standing in Ezindlovini in Oakford, KwaZulu-Natal, where a man is trapped halfway down a cliff. RUSA said it received a call for assistance from residents just after 8.30 am on Tuesday morning requesting assistance after they heard a man calling out for help. Reaction officers and medics travelled several kilometres on unpaved roads to reach the scene. “On arrival, reaction officers called out to the man who responded stating that he was injured and is losing energy. Officers do not have visual of him as the cliff face is covered by vegetation,” said RUSA. RUSA said its members are currently awaiting the arrival of the SAPS Search & Rescue Unit to free the man.
