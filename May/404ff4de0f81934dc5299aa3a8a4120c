A 63-year-old woman and a couple in their forties were tied up with cable ties during a robbery at the pensioner’s home on Ramiah Drive in Metcalfe Park, Tongaat on Tuesday morning. The Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) Tongaat Operations Center said they received a call for help just after 9.30 am after the pensioner's grandson arrived at home and found that the house had been ransacked. Rusa said it was established that the couple were visiting the elderly woman when three armed robbers attacked them. “The robbers restrained the victim’s hands with cable ties and forced them to the upper level of the house. A male victim was assaulted after he resisted. The victims were forced into different rooms while the suspects ransacked the home for valuables.” Rusa said jewellery, an X Box, a Playstation 4, a Sony Hifi, three laptops, two television sets and several household items were stolen. The elderly woman was taken to hospital for injuries she sustained during the robbery, said Rusa.
