Two workers had to be rushed to hospital on Thursday afternoon after they were crushed by a one-ton cable roll that fell over them on Thomas Halstead Drive in Sea View Durban. Netcare 911 said when the two people were removed from underneath the cable roll, they were found to have suffered serious injuries to their head, neck, and chest areas. Due to the nature of one of the workerâ€™s injuries, a Netcare 911 helicopter was activated to airlift the man to a specialist facility for the care he required. The second worker was stabilised at the scene and then taken to hospital.
