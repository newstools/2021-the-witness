eThekwini Metro Police shot dead a ‘vicious’ dog after it attacked a three-year-old child and her father on Thursday morning Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad, Metro Police spokesperson, said the incident happened around 8 am on Ford and Russell Street in Verulam. “We can confirm that a metro police officer shot a dog twice as he was trying to prevent the dog from attacking the 3-year-old child and her father,” said Sewpersad. Sewpersad said the dog latched on the father’s hands, who had to be taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. The child was unharmed, said Sewpersad. “The dog was vicious. It is unknown who the owner of the dog is,” he said. “The dog was on a public road, close to the Verulam central business district where hundreds of people are walking there, it shouldn’t have been there in my opinion.” Sewpersad said they are trying to find the owner of the dog. Reaction Unit South Africa, said the victim is a Malawian national who was trying to protect his daughter. They identified the dog as a mastiff breed. “The victim sustained bite wounds to both his hands. Three other pedestrians arrived on scene and complained that the dog had also attacked them,” said RUSA in a statement.
