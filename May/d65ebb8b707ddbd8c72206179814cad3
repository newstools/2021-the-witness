Four people were arrested after being caught withdrawing
cash from an ATM on Grays Inn Road in Brighton Beach, in Durban. They were also
caught with a two-litre container with various cards and over R29 000 cash. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele,
said on Thursday last week, May 6, police officers from Brighton Beach SAPS
received information about a group of people who were in possession of multiple
Sassa cards, various bank cards and were busy withdrawing money from an ATM. “They proceeded to an ATM on Grays Inn Road in Brighton
Beach. Four suspects were caught red handed with a two-litre container with
various cards. A total cash of R29 550 was also seized from the suspect,” said
Mbele. She said the people, aged between 18 and 48, were due to
appear on Monday morning before the Durban Magistrates’ Court on charges of
possession of stolen property and contravention of National Credit Act. “The public is advised not to hand in their cards to any
unauthorised persons as this amounts to a criminal offence,” warned Mbele.
