Former president Jacob Zuma is expected to appear in the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Monday morning to stand trial on several charges including corruption. However, it is uncertain whether the trial will proceed following the recent withdrawal of his legal team. It is likely that a new legal team will require time to prepare for trial. Zuma is charged along with French arms company, Thales, on one count of racketeering, 12 of fraud, four of corruption and one of money laundering. There will be road closures in the vicinity of the court on Monday morning. Msunduzi Municipality’s spokesperson, Thobeka Mafumbatha, said in a statement that parking will be cordoned off outside the Bessie Head Library to accommodate SAPS response vehicles. Parking will be prohibited on Church Street, from the Otto Street intersection to the AS Chetty Building. Freedom Square parking will be out of bounds from about 6am until the case is over. Church Street between Boshoff Street and Old Market Street will also be closed-off. Mafumbatha added that there will be a soft closure at be Church/Boshoff street where only minibus taxis and motorists going to the AS Chetty Building and other businesses in the area above Boshoff Street would be allowed to go through at this closure point. She said traffic will not be allowed to proceed beyond the new taxi rank exit, outside AS Chetty Building. “We will have a hard closure in Church Street outside the judge's entrance where we will put speed fence. Church Street/Old Market, will also have a hard closure with speed fence,” she said. She added that traffic moving along Old Market Street will be compelled to turn left into Church Street and proceed up towards City Hall or turn right into Otto Street towards Pietermaritz Street. Vehicles moving from City Hall will be able to drive down and turn left into Otto Street or turn right into Old Market Street.
