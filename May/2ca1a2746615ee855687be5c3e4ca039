The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has confirmed two cases in Gauteng and two in KwaZulu-Natal of the B.1.617.2 Covid-19 variant which is circulating in India. In a statement on Sunday the NICD, a division of the National Health Laboratory Service said it has sequenced Covid-19 specimens from individuals with a recent travel history to India. “The institute can confirm that four of the specimens tested positive for B.1.617.2 (two cases from Gauteng and two from KwaZulu-Natal). “The B.1.617.2 variant is currently highlighted as a variant of interest by the World Health Organisation and is one of multiple variants ... in India.” NICD said all cases have been isolated and managed according to Covid-19 guidelines and contact tracing had been performed in order to limit the spread of this variant. “Another variant that is currently dominating Covid-19 infections in Europe and North America, B.1.1.7 has also been detected in South Africa. “Eleven cases of B.1.1.7 have been confirmed, with eight cases in the Western Cape, two cases in Gauteng and one case in KwaZulu-Natal,” said the NICD. “It is not surprising that new variants have been detected in SA”, says NICD acting executive director Professor Adrian Puren. “We would like to assure the public that the institute is focusing their resources and research efforts towards understanding the variants and what the potential implications are for SA.” Dr Michelle Groome, head of the Division of Public Health Surveillance and Response at the NICD said that provincial health authorities remain on high alert and are prioritising the sequencing of Covid-19 positive samples from travellers entering the country, specifically those from India. “We understand that many are suffering from Covid-19 fatigue, and becoming lax ... But for the sake of yourselves and your loved ones, wash or sanitise your hands, wear your masks and maintain physical distance of 1,5 m from others,” Puren added.
