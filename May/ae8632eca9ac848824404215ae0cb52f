The South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) has advised
that from 9 am on Thursday morning, from May 6, the Peter Brown bridge will be
closed for jacking and repairs possibly for next 48 hours. Hilton ward councillor Craig Millar said going forward, the
Peter Brown offramp will be closed from May 12 to November this year. “This is going to result in higher traffic volumes on Old
Howick and Athlone circle as well as Montrose and Sanctuary Road circle. “Msunduzi and uMngeni Traffic Departments are aware of this
as are RTI and additional presence and law enforcement will be provided during
this period,” said Millar. He urged residents to change their schedules to avoid heavy
traffic hours if possible, or to plan for additional travel time during the
upgrade period.
