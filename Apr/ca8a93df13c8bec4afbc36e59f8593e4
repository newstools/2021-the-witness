A cow, trapped under the hooves of five others, would have died if she wasn’t rescued by police and SPCA officials on Saturday. Members of the SAPS Search and Rescue team and officers from the dog unit spotted the cattle, which were transported in a small trailer, while patrolling on the N3, near Pietermaritzburg. “The six cattle were lying on top of each other in the trailer, crushing the bottom cow,” Roland Fivaz, manager of the Pietermaritzburg SPCA, said. “The cow was already starting to bloat and would have been dead by the time they reached Greytown, their final destination.” After pulling the driver off the road, the police called the SPCA, who told them to bring the cattle to their premises in Woodhouse Road, where they were released into an enclosure. The trapped cow, which is reportedly on her feet and grazing, is being monitored by staff. Fivaz said the Pietermaritzburg SPCA intends opening cases of animal cruelty.
