One of the 16 prisoners who were still on the run after they escaped in Pietermaritzburg on Wednesday, has been rearrested. Police spokesperson, Brigadier Jay Naicker, said Thubelihle Dlomo (19), who was previously arrested for murder, was rearrested on Friday morning at KwaDukuza. Dlomo is part of the 45 awaiting trial prisoners who were being transported from New Prison to the Pietermaritzburg Magistrates Court when armed gunmen forced the prisoner transport vehicle off the road. By Wednesday afternoon, 27 of the 45 prisoners were back in police custody while 18 were confirmed to be on the run. On Thursday morning, two more were rearrested. The number of those on the run now sits at 15 after Dlomo’s arrest. “We are still tracking the movements of the remaining 15 awaiting trial prisoners that are still on the run,” said Naicker. He urged anyone who may have information on the other prisoners’ whereabouts to contact Brigadier Hlongwane 079 684 9114 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
