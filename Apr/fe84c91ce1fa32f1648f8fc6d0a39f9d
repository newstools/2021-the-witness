Uefa and English, Spanish and Italian football authorities announced on Sunday that any clubs who take part in a so-called European Super League would be banned from all other domestic and continental competitions. European football’s governing body said it had learned that some English, Spanish and Italian clubs might announce a breakaway competition. There have been no reports that French or German clubs would be part of the Super League. The New York Times reported that at least 12 clubs have signed up for the competition, including Juventus and seven-time European champions AC Milan, who have not played in the Champions League since 2014. Sky Sports reported that Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea were among six Premier League teams set to be part of the plans. “If this were to happen, we wish to reiterate that we — Uefa, the English FA, RFEF, FIGC, the Premier League, La Liga, Lega Serie A, but also Fifa and all our member associations — will remain united in our efforts to stop this cynical project, a project that is founded on the self-interest of a few clubs at a time when society needs solidarity more than ever.” ALSO READ | Wide broadcasting of all the Uefa action secured.
