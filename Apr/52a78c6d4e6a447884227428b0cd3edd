The Consul General of India, Anish Rajan, has invited Msunduzi Municipality to submit a “job oriented proposal” for a skills centre of excellence in information and communication technology (ICT) in Pietermaritzburg. He also encouraged students interested in studying ICT related courses to apply for scholarships to study in India. “Once we have a centre in the capital city, there would be no worries about the challenges of sending students to India and we would be able to have more students, even from outside the city, enrolled at the centre instead of the few students that get the opportunity to go and study in India.” said Rajan. The consul general, along with Kajari Biswas, the head of chancery, visited the municipality this week and were welcomed by deputy mayor, Manilal Inderjit. Municipal spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha said the meeting was in relation to the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) offering scholarships to students to pursue undergraduate, postgraduate and higher course programmes at institutions and universities in India. The scholarships include full tuition fees, a monthly stipend or living allowance, a rental allowance, and airfare tickets. Rajan advised the municipality to encourage students to apply for the scholarship, which closes on May 30, 2021. Applications can be found on www.a2ascholarships.iccr.gov.in
