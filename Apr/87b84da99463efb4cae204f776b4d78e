The body of 27-year-old Nkosingiphile Mazibuko was discovered in KwaDabeka, near Pinetown, on Thursday. Police officers, who found her, said the killer cut the victim into two halves. It’s believed she was killed elsewhere and then dumped in the township's Sub 5 section. Sources close to the Mazibuko family said Nkosingiphile had gone out on Saturday to spend time with friends. She never returned home. On Tuesday, her parents went to the Kwadabeka Police Station to report her missing. Two days later her body was found by the SAPS. KZN police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, confirmed that a case of murder has been opened and that officers from KwaDabeka are investigating. No suspects have been arrested. In a statement, Mzamo Billy, chairperson of the DA West Durban Constituency, condemned the murder, describing it as a “brutal and senseless killing.” The party is also concerned by the growing number of murders in the area, with 95 recorded in the 2018/2019 crime statistics, and another 27 cases in the third quarter of 2020/2021. “We call upon for law enforcement authorities to find the culprit and make an urgent arrest so that the family can get closure,” Billy said. “We trust that the perpetrator/s of this vicious act will be swiftly brought to book and that justice will be served.” Billy and other members of the DA will be visiting the family next week. Nkosingiphile's funeral is expected to take place on Saturday. Anyone with any information about the case is asked to contact Crime Stop at 08600 10111.
