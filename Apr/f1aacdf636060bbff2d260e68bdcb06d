The Durban University of Technology (DUT) has announced that the deadline for online registration for first time applicants and returning students has been extended to Friday, April 16. But the five Durban campuses will remain closed for the time being following violent protests there last week. DUT said that remote, online learning for first time enrolling students will however commence on Monday, April 12. “This will ensure that the academic programme can successfully conclude within this calendar year. It needs to be noted that the majority of first time enrolling students have already registered. “As previously announced, returning students commenced with their remote, online learning on March 29. The closure of the five Durban campuses will continue until further notice. This will allow the University to consider and assess many pre-requisites for re-opening and for allowing students, albeit in a restricted way still, to return to campus. As previously announced, returning students commenced with their remote, online learning on March 29. ALSO READ | Residents of Glenwood Durban oppose demolitions to build student flats.
