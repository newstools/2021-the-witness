A suspected stock thief was arrested on the R56 to Richmond this week and three cows- one of them dead- were found in the vehicle he was travelling in. Magma Security and Investigations head, Shaheen Sulieman, said his members and those from the Underberg police stock theft unit were conducting observation duties on the R56 when they observed a white Ford Ranger, with the registration NPS 84993, approaching them. “Members tried to stop the vehicle but it sped off in the direction of Richmond on the R56. After a short chase four men alighted from the vehicle while it was still in motion and fled into the bush.” The members managed to arrest one man. The vehicle continued moving on the R56, swerved off the road and collided with a tree. Sulieman added that on inspecting the vehicle, members found three cattle tied up and covered with a shade cloth in the bin of the bakkie. One had died.
