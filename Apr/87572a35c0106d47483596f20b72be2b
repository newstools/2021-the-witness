Following his arrival in KwaZulu-Natal, the recently
appointed Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, made
it his first order of business to turnaround the crime in the Umgungundlovu
District. The Plessislaer police precinct, which features as one of
the most troublesome areas in the province as well as the country, will be
receiving focused attention. The Imbali area within Plessislaer will be getting
the majority of the additional police deployments that the Provincial
Commissioner has mustered. On Thursday, 8 April, Mkhwanazi met with police leadership
in the Umgungundlovu District at the Plessislaer police station to get an
understanding of the crime challenges and the difficulties encountered by
police officers on the ground. During the session, the Mkhwanazi marshalled a large
contingent of police officers that will be focusing on the rollout of dedicated
operations in the days ahead. A plan was put in place, which will be monitored
on a daily basis by the Provincial Commissioners office. Weekly evaluation
sessions to assess the effectiveness of the operations and to plan for the
weeks ahead are part of the package. “We want criminals in
the area to feel our presence and the community must expect large scale
disruptions on certain days as we lockdown specific areas that are troublesome.
We are also going to be rolling out such interventions in other challenging
crime hotspots within the province in the days ahead. It is important that [we]
approach our crime combatting operations in a concerted manner to ensure that
we are more effective,” said Mkhwanazi.
