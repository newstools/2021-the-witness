A high-speed chase and a shootout with the police has
resulted in Sihle Zulu (24) and Ayanda Thabethe (29) being sentenced to 49
years and three months imprisonment and 61 years and three months imprisonment
respectively in the Durban Regional Court. Natasha Kara, spokesperson for the KZN DPP, said the two were
convicted of various charges that followed a high-speed chase on the N2 freeway
near the vicinity of Nandi Drive in August 2017. Prior to the incident, Kara said police had received
information that suspects driving a particular car planned to rob the petrol
station on Nandi Drive. “Police officials spotted the car and pursued it. Whilst in
pursuit, the suspects shot at the police, and thereafter collided into a police
[car] and other [cars].” Both Zulu and Thabethe were arrested, while their other
three accomplices who were shot during the altercation died on the scene. Kara said the police recovered firearms with ammunition,
various car and housebreaking implements and a police radio. They also
discovered that the car used in the commission of the offence was stolen. In court, Kara said regional court prosecutor Sureka
Marimuthu led an array of evidence to secure the conviction. She said Zulu and Thabethe were convicted and sentenced for
the murders of their accomplices (common purpose), attempted murder, unlawful
possession of firearms and ammunition, unlawful possession of live ammunition,
possession of car breaking implements, unlawful possession of a police radio,
stolen vehicle and reckless and negligent driving. While the accused were sentenced to 49 and 61 years
effectively, the presiding officer ordered that some sentences would run
concurrently. Both men were deemed unfit to possess a firearm.
