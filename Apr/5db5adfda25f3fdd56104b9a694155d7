Road construction around Town Hill has already begun and will soon escalate to the closure of the Peter Brown off-ramp in order to repair the infamous bridge over the N3. Hilton ward councillor Craig Millar said he and other councillors called a meeting with the South African National Roads Agency (Sanral), the Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI), Umngeni Traffic, Department of Traffic, contractors and engineers last week to discuss measures that will lessen the risk and inconvenience the Hilton area will suffer during this "unfortunate but necessary" process. “Law enforcement, signage, traffic diversions and repairs to our road infrastructure were on the agenda and I believe we have some constructive proactive ideas that will improve what is going to be a busy period which is likely to take around 18 months. “Alternative routes to the N3 and changing up hours, if possible, when you will access Pietermaritzburg is recommended. Further updates, as we get them from other role players, will be communicated on various platforms so that they can be shared with as many people as possible,” said Millar.
