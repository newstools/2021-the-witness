A blue Toyota Hilux bakkie, which had been transporting 11 people, plunged off a bridge on New Glasgow Road, Hazelmere, KwaZulu-Natal, on Friday. Sources at the scene said the vehicle was being driven by a 16-year-old boy, who was reportedly intoxicated. The teenager and his passengers had been travelling towards Verulam when he lost control of the bakkie, which landed in a dense, bushy area, several meters below the road. Paramedics from Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) rushed to the scene after their operations centre received multiple calls for assistance from passing motorists. Seven people were transported to local hospitals for treatment. The SAPS is investigating the accident.
