Outraged by the alleged conditions Opal the orangutan has been subjected to, animal rights group, Ban Animal Trading (Bat), will be protesting outside the Natal Zoological Gardens on Saturday. The protest is over Opal’s “solitary confinement” for nearly 40 years. Bat director, Prathna Singh, said Opal has become the poster child of its movement, which seeks to do away with all zoological confinements of animals. “Opal has become a poster child for the movement simply because of the horrible existence she has had to endure her entire life. Her parents died when she was fairly young and since then she has been alone for almost 40 years. If anyone could see what she has been through and is going through, they would want to stand up for her the way we are trying to,” said Singh. She added that over the years Bat has tried to engage with the zoo but has been met with a stern refusal to any suggestion regarding Opal’s living conditions. Bat wants Opal to be housed in a better facility. “At the very least, something needs to be done so she doesn’t spend her very last few years living alone in captivity. “We are asking for an independent vet to assess her and advise on what the best thing for her is, to give her a better life as the way she currently lives is not acceptable,” said Singh. Bat has confirmed that the protest action is legal, with permission from police having been obtained. The protest will begin from 10 am at the intersection of MR477 Road and Lion Park Road outside the entrance to Lion Park in Cato Ridge. Attempts to get comment from the zoo were unsuccessful.
