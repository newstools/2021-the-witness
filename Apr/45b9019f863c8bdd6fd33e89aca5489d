The Zulu royal family should, without delay, appoint the successor of the late Zulu King, Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu, in light of the passing of the Zulu nation Regent, Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu on Thursday. This is according to Zulu cultural expert, Professor Sihawu Ngubane. “In his statement the Zulu nation Prime Minister, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, indicated that there would be no leadership vacuum as a result of the death of the Zulu nation Regent, Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu. “We expect that the royal family will immediately appoint the new King to avoid a contestation within the royal family,” he said. On Wednesday The Witness reported that Queen Manfombi Dlamini Zulu, who was announced as the Zulu nation Regent a few days after King Zwelithini’s passing in March, had been admitted to hospital. Ngubane said it was the first time in the history of Zulu nation that both the King and the Queen have died within close proximity. Queen Dlamini Zulu’s main role as Zulu nation Regent was to prepare for the coronation of the new King. While the Zulu royal family was yet to confirm King Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu’s successor, Queen Dlamini Zulu’s eldest son, Misuzulu Zulu, is widely considered to be the front-runner. Prince Mangosuthu said the Zulu royal family would be announcing preparations for Queen Dlamini Zulu’s funeral in due course.
