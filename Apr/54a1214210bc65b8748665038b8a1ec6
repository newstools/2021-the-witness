Driven by the need to relocate to a facility more ‘fit for purpose', the Royal Agricultural Society of Natal announced on Friday that it has accepted a proposal from Vu-Tact Trade and Invest (Pty) Ltd to purchase the Showgrounds. Terry Strachan, CEO of the Royal Agricultural Society of Natal of Natal, said the intention in time is to convert the site to a ‘mixed-use’ development, catering for retail, office, and residential components. Strachan said the agreement is subject to a number of suspensive conditions, relating to an Environmental Impact Assessment and other feasibility studies. “It is anticipated that the process will take up to three years to complete, during which time the Royal Agricultural Society’s normal activities will continue at its current address”. In the interim, Strachan said the Society’s management has begun evaluating alternative locations outside of, but in close proximity to Pietermaritzburg. The showgrounds has over the years become an integral part of Pietermaritzburg community. For many years, the Royal Agriculture Society has hosted the much loved and anticipated annual Royal Show at the showgrounds. The Royal Show boasts of being the largest mixed exhibition incorporating a fully-fledged agricultural component on the continent of Africa. Not only does this include the exposition of some of the country’s finest livestock and agricultural equipment, but also a range of ancillary activities and displays covering the industrial, commercial and service sectors within the province.
