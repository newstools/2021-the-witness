This is according to the centre’s 2021-22 Global 2000 List. UKZN features as one of the top 2,5% of universities out of 19 788 worldwide. The centre publishes the largest academic rankings of global universities and is a leading consulting organisation providing policy advice, strategic insights, and consulting services to governments and universities to improve educational and research outcomes. Professor Mosa Moshabela, acting deputy vice chancellor of research at UKZN, welcomed the results. He said it confirms the university’s continued position as a leading research-intensive university in Africa and the world. “Whilst there are many other attributes that characterise UKZN as a top university in Africa ... it is always a pleasure to see how we perform as an institution relative to our peers nationally and globally.
