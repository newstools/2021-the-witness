A 46-year-old man was found dead by his mother sitting in his wheelchair with his hands tied behind his back at his Winterton home on Saturday morning. Police spokesperson, Captain Bongani Nyathi, of the Ladysmith Police Station, said he was murdered at the Skietdrif Farm in Winterton. Police were called out to the scene at 10.13 am. Nyathi said that it is alleged that the man’s mother arrived at the house and found an employee working inside the house. She informed her that her son is still asleep in his room. The mother then went into the room and found him sitting in his wheelchair with his hands tied behind his back. Nyathi added that he was pronounced dead at the scene. “There were bruises on the man’s neck,” he said. At this stage, added Nyathi, it is unclear if anything was stolen from the house. Police are investigating a murder case and no arrests have yet been made. He added that the motive is unknown at this stage. He has requested any person who can assist with information pertaining to the case to contact the toll free number 08600 10111 or to contact them on the “My SAPS” App.
