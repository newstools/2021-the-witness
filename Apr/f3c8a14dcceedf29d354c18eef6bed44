A 25-year-old police constable from the Durban Central police station was shot and injured while trying to stop a cash-in-transit robbery at a shopping mall on Tuesday. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker said the officers had visited a shopping mall in Durban to view video footage that could assist them in an investigation that they were conducting. “As they were viewing the footage, they were alerted to a cash-in-transit robbery that had taken place on the premises and they immediately responded.” Naicker said it is alleged that at around 3.30 pm, the cash-in-transit guard was conveying a cash box to his car when five men confronted him and forcefully removed the cash box from him. “The police officers came to his assistance and managed to prevent the men from fleeing with the moneybox. The suspects opened fire on the police officers and injured a 25-year-old constable as well as the security guard as the fled empty handed. “Both the police officer and security guard were transported to a local hospital where they remain in a critical condition. Detectives from the Hawks are investigating the cash-in-transit robbery and a manhunt is underway to trace the perpetrators,” said Naicker. The KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi applauded the police officers for immediately springing into action and preventing the robbers from fleeing with the cash. “We are saddened to hear that a police officer and security guard were injured in this skirmish with the robbers, and we wish them a speedy recovery. We will do everything that is with our control to bring the perpetrators to book,” said Lieutenant General Mkhwanazi.
