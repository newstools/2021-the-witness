A 30-year-old man has appeared in court charged with killing his friend, who, it’s alleged, he believed was spending too much time on his cellphone. According to the SAPS KZN media centre, the man, who has not been named, stabbed 35-year-old Sandile Buthelezi. The man, who appeared in the Mtunzini Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday, was "chilling" with Buthelezi and some other friends at 10.40 pm on January 26 in Salveshe Road, Isikhalambazo, Mandini. The two men reportedly began arguing. “The suspect was annoyed by Buthelezi; that he was spending a lot of time talking on his phone instead of conversing with them,” Colonel Thembeka Mbele said in the statement. “He continued to provoke Buthelezi, but was stopped by some friends and he walked away.” The man then returned a few minutes later and allegedly stabbed the victim twice in the chest. “Buthelezi attempted to fight back but was too frail to stop the suspect,” Mbele said. “He was rushed to hospital in critical condition where he succumbed to his injuries.” A murder case was opened at the Sundumbili Police Station. The suspect was traced and arrested the same day for murder.
