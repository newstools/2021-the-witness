Gospel star and medical Doctor Dr Tumi, whose real name is Tumisang Victor Makweya (39) and his wife Kgaogelo Sara Makweya were released on bail on Tuesday after they were arrested for allegedly defrauding the National Lotteries Board. According to TimesLive, Hawk's spokesperson, Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu said the couple was listed as committee members at a non-profit organisation when the alleged fraud took place. She said they allegedly submitted altered grant application documents to the National Lotteries Board for approval of funds on projects in 2018. TimesLive quoted her as saying, “Further investigation revealed that the couple together with their co-accused who have since been released on R5 000 bail each, Chistopher Tshivule (46) and Thomas Ndadza (48) allegedly altered information on the documents submitted to the National Lotteries in September 2018 which resulted to the amount of over R1.5 million being transferred into a private bank account.” "The couple allegedly benefited approximately R760 000 from the funds.” Mulamu said the couple handed themselves in at the Johannesburg office escorted by their attorney and were subsequently charged for fraud. She said Dr Tumi and his wife appeared in the Palm Ridge Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on Tuesday and were granted bail of R3000 each. The case was postponed to May 7 this year for docket disclosure. The gospel star's fans took to Twitter to share their disbelief and disappointment on the matter.
