Five alleged poachers were arrested in possession of ammunition, a silencer and two high calibre rifles in the Kruger National Park at the weekend. They were found in the Pretoriuskop section, said Gareth Coleman, the managing executive of the park. He said, “It has been a successful weekend in the fight to keep our rhinos alive in the park.
