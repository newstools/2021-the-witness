Pensioners at Tugela Ferry Post Office in Msinga, near Greytown are still reeling in shock after two armed men entered the offices, held the staff at gunpoint and demanded safe keys and cash on Tuesday. Spokesperson for SA Post Office Nobuhle Njapha said no cash was taken during the botched robbery. “The staff at the office were traumatised due to the incident and trauma counselling was arranged. “Post Offices that are the victims of robberies are regarded as crime scenes by the police, and they have to be closed until the forensic investigation is complete to avoid disturbing the crime scene. The office is open for customer today [Wednesday],” Njapha said. KZN police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said the police are investigating a case of attempted business robbery. “It is alleged that two unknown suspects entered the business premises at Tugela Ferry. At gunpoint, the suspects demanded the safe keys and money. The police were alerted, and the suspects fled the scene. The matter is still under investigation,” Gwala said.
