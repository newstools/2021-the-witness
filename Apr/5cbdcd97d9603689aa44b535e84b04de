Hundreds of commuters in Durban have been left stranded as taxi drivers closed off multiple busy roads during a protest on Thursday. According to sources, the protest is over the taxi drivers' unhappiness with the constant fines and arrests from eThekwini Metro Police. By 5 am, taxi drivers formed blockades on Warwick Avenue, West Street and Umgeni Road. Sifiso Shangase, Kwazulu-Natal South African National Taxi Association spokesperson, said he was aware there had been growing tensions between Durban taxi drivers and law enforcement over operating permits. Shangase said a lot of drivers complained they were being taken off the road by metro police over expired permits despite having documentation they were in line for a renewal. “At this moment we don't know whether the strike was initiated by the drivers themselves or the owners and I will have to engage eThekwini leadership for that,” he said. By 11.30 am police had started clearing the debris off the streets and opening routes. Intra-city taxis and buses are still not operating. Police were not immediately available for comment. This is a developing story.
