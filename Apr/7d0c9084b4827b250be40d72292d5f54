The main arterial roads leading into the Central and Northern Berg Drakensberg basins are in ruin. These concerns have been raised by the ward councillor in the Okhahlamba area, Thys Janse van Rensburg. Janse van Rensburg said these ruined roads will carry thousands of visitors this Easter holiday season as they escape the confines of the city. He said the past wet summer season exacerbated the problem but said the Roads Department should have responded with greater action. “Unfortunately, many weeks after the rains subsided little action is to be seen.  The problem is worsening by the day, and despite many promises and meetings the situation is now reaching critical status.” Janse van Rensburg said the R74 from Olivier’s Hoek pass to Winterton should be avoided at night, and only approached with great caution during the day. He said the R600 is in somewhat better shape but still has hazardous sections. Most of the smaller roads in between hotels and establishments are crumbling away and can be access at a snail’s pace. “The Department of Transport seems to lack the skill to resolve this crises, and it will end up costing many livelihoods as tourist turn elsewhere. In the rural municipality of Okahalamba Tourism and agriculture is the only job creators, and governments ineptness makes it hard for residents to earn a living to support and feed families,” said Janse van Rensburg. He said another fear he had was that the UNESCO Okhahlamba park will also suffer major reputable harm as local and foreign tourists struggle to reach this desired destination. “I call in the governing party, and Premier [Sihle] Zikalala to save many tourism jobs by fixing our roads. In the Okhahlamba Tourism sector the vast majority of Establishments provide their own water, sanitation and energy, all we ask from our tax money is for working roads,” pleaded Janse van Rensburg.
