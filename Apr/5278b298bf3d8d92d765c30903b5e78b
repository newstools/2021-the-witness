A man, who allegedly hit his mother in the head with an axe, has appeared in court, charged with her murder. Loyiso Ngcobo (28) appeared at the Maphumulo Magistrate’s Court in KwaZulu-Natal on Monday. He was remanded in police custody until May 5 when he is expected to appear in the Nsuze Magistrate’s Court for a bail application. Ngcobo’s court appearance follows the murder of 62-year-old, Thokozile Ngcobo, on April 22 in the Nomhele area, Bhamshela, in Nsuze. According to the SAPS KZN media centre, Ngcobo was dismantling the roof of the family home because he wanted to sell the corrugated iron. His mother did not approve of the plan and an altercation ensued. Thokozile then went to her room and the accused followed her, with an axe in hand, hitting her on the back of her head. He then fled the scene. Thokozile succumbed to her injury at the scene. The SAPS traced Ngcobo to the Appelsbosch area, where he was arrested and charged with murder.
