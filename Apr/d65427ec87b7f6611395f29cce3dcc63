Over 40 Msunduzi TVET students spent Monday night sleeping outside the campus gate after their landlords kicked them out after failing to pay rent since the beginning of the financial year. The students who are from different places including Mpangeni, Eastern Cape, and Newcastle in northern KZN said that they could not pay their landlords because they have not received their allowances from the National Student Financial Aid System (NSFAS). The SRC president at Msunduzi Campus Sthembile Kunene told The Witness that usually the students get their allowances shortly after they start their academic year but it has not happened. She said after students were kicked out by the landlords they tried to speak to the campus management to explain their situation and obtain permission to sleep inside the campus but the management refused. “This is so painful to see students sleep on the streets because they want education.The campus management told us that the students cannot be allowed to spend the night inside the campus. She said students had nothing to sleep on. “We were assisted by other comrades who saw pictures trending on social media last night and they came and helped us with sponges (foam mattresses) and blankets,” she said. When The Witness visited the campus on Tuesday morning, some students were still sleeping and others were singing outside the campus gate. They vowed that they will close the campus until their demands are met and they have a place to stay. This is a developing story.
