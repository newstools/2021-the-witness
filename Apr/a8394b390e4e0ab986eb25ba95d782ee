suspended following allegations of an affair with a prisoner. The scandal comes after two Department of
Correctional Services employees were dismissed this month, following a viral
video of an official and inmate having sex. The official is stationed at the Durban Westville
Female Correctional Centre, according to a report by the Sunday Tribune. The official and prisoner were reportedly caught in
the act at the beginning of the month in a conference room at the correctional
centre. The woman is reportedly serving a 20-year sentence for murder. The suspension of the member, who cannot be named,
comes at a time when a female prison warden, who was filmed in a sex romp with
a male prisoner at Ncome Correctional Facility, was fired last week. Potentially 'damaging' allegations Provincial department spokesperson Thulani Mdluli
told News24 that an investigation is under way. He said: Mdluli added that the departmental code of conduct "is
against any improper, disgraceful or unacceptable" actions by an official
on duty. ALSO READ | Prison officer facing disciplinary after video surfaces of sex with inmate "These allegations have the potential of
