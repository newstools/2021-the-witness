A seven-year-old boy with special needs was found locked up, with dogs, in a house in Umlazi, near Durban. The child, who had no food, water or electricity, was spotted by neighbours, who alerted the authorities. It is believed that the boy was left in the care of his father by his grandmother, and that he allegedly left him locked in the house for more than a month. KwaZulu-Natal Social Development MEC, Nonhlanhla Khoza, said she was shocked to learn about the case, adding that her department would “intensify efforts to protect children from neglect and undetectable abuse.” She added: “We never thought a parent could do such a thing to his own child. “The child has been left in such a despicable condition. No child deserves to be treated like this and there is no explanation that can be accepted from the parents of this poor child.” A team of social workers has been dispatched to provide psycho-social support to the boy, who has been removed from the house and taken to a place of safety.
