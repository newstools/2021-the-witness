A parolee has been arrested in Ulundi, KwaZulu-Natal, after he killed a taxi owner’s wife 10 days after he was released after serving seven years in prison. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said on April 8, the provincial taxi task team arrested Zakhele Bhobho Nkose (32) in Ulundi for the murder of a taxi owner’s wife Bongi Nhlebela (43). Nkosi appeared in the Nongoma Magistrate’s Court the next day and was remanded in custody until April 19, for bail application. Nkosi had been released from prison on parole on March 3, this year after serving seven of his 15 years for robbery. Gwala said it is alleged that Nhlebela was at her home in Nongoma on March 13, when Nkosi, who was looking for her husband who is a taxi owner, accosted her. “Nkosi was furious when he did not find the husband and turned the gun on Nhlebela, fatally wounding her. A murder case was opened at Nongoma and the provincial taxi team took over the investigations,” said Gwala. She said an intensive investigation led the police to Ulundi where Nkosi was hiding. He was arrested and charged with murder.
