Three men were arrested by the Mountain Rise Police on Saturday night after assaulting a woman at knifepoint before robbing her. The police confirmed the woman had been on Govinda Road in Northdale when the robbers pinned her to the ground and took her handbag, cellphone, gold chain and other items. Members of community activist group, Assist Me Now, said they responded after receiving information that a robbery was underway on Govinda Road. “We immediately proceeded to the area and found the woman who had been robbed and she then pointed members of the group in the direction of where the men had fled through after she was robbed,” the communist activist said. Mountain Rise police station spokesperson, Sean Singh, said police were investigating a case of aggravated robbery. “One suspect was arrested on Chetty Road where the woman’s handbag was found hidden amongst plants while other members of the SAPS searched for the other two men and managed to arrest them at their residence. “A case of aggravated robbery was opened at the Mountain Rise Police Station where all three men were detained after being positively identified by the woman. “The knife used was found on one of the men and was entered as evidence. The woman sustained injuries for which she received treatment,” Chetty said.
