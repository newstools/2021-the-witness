As the world watches in horror at the Covid-19 tragedy playing out in India, Pietermaritzburg-based Gift of the Givers is preparing to provide the country with practical and effective assistance. The organisation’s founder, Dr Imtiaz Sooliman, likened the second wave of the coronavirus in India as a tsumani, adding that official figures did not provide a true picture of what their supporters on the ground were seeing. “The pictures, as graphic as they are, can never adequately convey the emotion, pain, suffering and desperation,” he added. “Living inside a disaster is very different to observing it from a distance. If observing it from a distance is horrific, imagine living in it. “Healthcare workers and the population are on edge, exhausted and burnt out. They need humanity to respond.” Sooliman said Gift of the Givers had been in discussion with the Indian government and South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation on how it can help. “The request is very simple, ‘we need oxygen and oxygen delivery devices, we have everything else’,” Sooliman said. “Oxygen provision is extremely complicated and is in reality a government to government responsibility. “The public can play a role in the purchase of oxygen concentrators, which Gift of the Givers is busy procuring. “But the most critical, life saving intervention is the CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machines that Gift of the Givers delivered during SA’s second wave. “Healthcare workers named it the ‘life saver’.” • Gift of the Givers invites those who want to participate in assisting India to make contributions into their bank account.
