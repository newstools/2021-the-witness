A security guard from a Howick security company has been arrested after he shot and killed a man in the Howick area on Sunday evening. Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson, Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese, told The Witness that Martin Xaba (48) was shot eight times. Ngobese said it is alleged that Xaba had an argument with another person in a house in the Howick area. Ngobese said the other person managed to take a firearm from Xaba and called for assistance from a security company. “He went to the road to hand the firearm to the security guards. The deceased [Xaba] came to the road and started to fire at the security personnel. “One of the security guards ... fired warning shots at [Xaba] from the back. [Xaba] fell to the ground,” said Ngobese. Midlands EMRS was called to the scene and attended to Xaba at 8 pm. He was still alive. He died at about 8.30 pm. Ngobese said Xaba had suffered one shot to the left temple, four on the chest and three on the abdomen. The security guard subsequently handed himself over to Howick SAPS. Ngobese said he was placed under arrest and his firearm was confiscated. Two other firearms were found at the scene and handed in as exhibits.
