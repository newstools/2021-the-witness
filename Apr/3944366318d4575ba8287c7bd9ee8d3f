KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala has welcomed the declaration by President
Cyril Ramaphosa to grant the late former and first democratically elected premier of KwaZulu-Natal, Dr Frank Mdlalose, a Special Official Provincial
Funeral Category 2. A Special Provincial Official Funeral Category 2 is given to
distinguished persons specifically designated by the President of South Africa
on request by the premier of a province. Premier Zikalala said Mdlalose will be remembered for his
prominent role as a leader and negotiator during the Codesa negotiations which
were held at Kempton Park and eventually led to the 1994 elections. Zikalala said he also
played an instrumental role in cultivating peace in the province of
KwaZulu-Natal working alongside senior leaders of the ANC and the IFP. Mdlalose's funeral will take place this
coming Thursday, April 8, at Madadeni Township in Newcastle. As part of the funeral arrangements, the South African
Police Service will provide ceremonial elements, and the flag will be flown at
half- mast in the province on the day. Zikalala said the granting of a special provincial funeral
to Dr Mdlalose by the President will ensure that his legacy to our nation is
aptly honoured and remembered.
