A former head of traffic and licensing in KwaZulu Natal has pleaded guilty to multiple counts of fraud relating to the irregular and unlawful issuing of learner licenses in Howick, KwaZulu-Natal. Simon Zwane, spokesperson for the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC), said Roger Alan Everton appeared in the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Durban on Wednesday facing 15 counts of fraud relating to allegations that he had underhandedly assisted learner license applicants to pass tests at the Umngeni licensing department. Everton, a former manager responsible for traffic policing and licensing at Umngeni Municipality, was arrested by the National Traffic Anti-Corruption Unit and the Hawks in 2018. His arrest followed the arrest of nine applicants and six officials – examiners and clerks at the licensing department on the same allegations of fraud.
