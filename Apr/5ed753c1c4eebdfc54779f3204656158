While orcas are not strangers to the KZN coast, sightings are rare. Ballito Ski Boat Club’s Peter Mitchell together with Riaan de Jonge, Eric Bott and Dean Halley were fishing for tuna in about 35 metres of water when a pod of dolphins shot past their vessel. “An entire pod of dolphins came screaming past, running for cover. Once they had passed us, about 10 minutes later, we saw some large fins that were not sharks...moving towards us,” Mitchell told the Witness. Mitchell, who shot a video of the orcas, said they moved towards them and stopped. “We turned all the motors and fish finders off and we were then visited by four killer whales or orcas.” He said to his knowledge, orcas often feed on dolphin. “From what I know, and I am no expert, they are often quite partial to dolphin so that’s clearly why the dolphins were running away from us. They were hunting in a zigzag pattern moving from south to north.” He said it is not an uncommon occurrence. “It has happened up and down the coast from time to time, but I think that is it pretty rare for this time of the year with the temperature of the water and pre-sardine run.”
