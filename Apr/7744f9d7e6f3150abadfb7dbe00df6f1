A small group of very brave endurance female paddlers will join their male counterparts on Friday morning for the Non-Stop Dusi Canoe Marathon. They will be covering the route of the traditional three-day MyLife Dusi Canoe Marathon in a single outing and bringing down the curtain on the rescheduled KZN canoeing calendar reshaped by the Covid-19 lockdown. Dusi runner-up and Euro Steel star Jordan Peek will be taking part in her K1, while her mother Kim hops into a K2 with Lorna Oliver. Among other women entries is the K2 of Tracey Oellermann and Cara Waud, while there are a handful of mixed doubles entered.

The race will see one K3 brave the route with Debbie Lewis, Sipho Canham and Jason Breedt looking to guide the three-person craft to Durban. The race rules stipulate that all paddlers must go under the College Road Bridge, but the race opens up from there as paddlers have to decide which stretches to portage and paddle. As a result of the race taking place later in the year, the later start has forced changes to the traditional cut-offs at Finger Neck and the Inanda dam wall, with the final cut-off at the N2 bridge ensuring that all paddlers are accounted for and no boats are left trying to complete the race in the dark.
