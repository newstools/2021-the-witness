Severe thunderstorms are expected over parts of the KZN Midlands, Durban and surrounding areas within the eThekwini Metro, as well as on the South Coast. Heavy downpours, strong winds and severe lightning have been forecast by the South African Weather Service (SAWS). The storms could result in damage to infrastructure, especially in informal settlements and rural areas, with flooding of low-lying bridges and roads possible. Driving conditions will be poor, due to slippery roads and low visibility. Hail and lightning have also been forecast and could pose a danger to both humans and livestock. SAWS advises residents to stay indoors, but, if you are outdoors, seek shelter immediately â€” but not under trees, telephone lines and power lines.
