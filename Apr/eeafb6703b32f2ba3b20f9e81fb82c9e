A crackdown on businesses who owe Msunduzi Municipality is currently underway in the Pietermaritzburg Central Business District. Msunduzi finance head Nelisiwe Ngcobo said at least 23 businesses who are accused of owing money would be disconnected on Friday. The businesses owe the council a combined R726 million in water and electricity. She said the initial disconnections will target businesses owing around R30 million of this amount. “We have two groups that are visiting different businesses. We will disconnect them today [Friday],” said Ngcobo. First Class hair salon was the first business to be disconnected. First Class hair salon manager who only identified himself as Abdul said he was aware the business owed the city but didn’t understand why the business was disconnected. Hair stylists were forced to do their hair in the dark. While others could not continue working. They declined to comment. At around 10.30 am on Friday, Ngcobo along with the municipality’s meter readers were at Assurance Road where car dealership Inspectacar and TP Sunrise chemical and cleaning supplies were stating their case. They allegedly owe R800 000. TP chemical and cleaning supply owner Derick Van Der Merwe said he had already paid part of his debt. “We have been to the municipality more than 20 times and we didn’t get any help. These people are just lazy,” said Van Der Merwe.
