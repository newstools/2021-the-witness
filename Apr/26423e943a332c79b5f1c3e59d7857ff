Police arrested two men at a Pietermaritzburg car dealership on Wednesday after a sting operation caught the men in the act of trying to fraudulently buy a car to the value of R720 000. Radley Govender, owner of RZS Security which provides security to the dealership, told The Witness they received information the two men were planning to defraud the dealership. Thereafter Pietermaritzburg (PMB) Crime Intelligence, the Loop Street Police and his security company immediately conducted an operation to apprehend the men. “The men operate by sending fraudulent paperwork belonging to unsuspecting people via email to car dealerships to obtain vehicle financing. Once approved the men pose as the people whose documents they have sent through and arrive at the dealership to sign and collect vehicles using fake paperwork,” said Govender. Govender said the men arrived at the dealership on Wednesday and once they signed to take possession of the vehicle the police, PMB crime intelligence and RZS members mobilised and immediately arrested the men. Police confirmed two men were arrested and charged with fraud at the Loop Street Police Station.
