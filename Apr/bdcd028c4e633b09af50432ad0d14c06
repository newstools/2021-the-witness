The South African Weather Service (Saws) has warned of widespread showers and thundershowers expected over most parts of KwaZulu-Natal on Friday. These will be scattered over the extreme north-eastern parts. Saws said the showers are expected to result in heavy falls that could result in localised flooding over most parts of KZN except the northern parts. With the expected increase in traffic as the school holidays are coming to an end, Saws said the expected rains could result in minor impacts. The areas which are expected to be affected include: Dr N. Dlamini-Zuma - Underberg, eThekwini, Greater Kokstad, Impendle, Ingwe, Inkosi Langalibalele - Escourt, Inkosi Langalibalele - Sobabili, KwaDukuza, Mandeni, Maphumulo, Mkhambathini, Mpofana - Giants Castle, Mpofana - Mooi River, Ndwedwe, Okhahlamba, Ray Nkonyeni, Richmond, Msunduzi, Ubuhlebezwe, Umdoni, uMlalazi, uMngeni, uMshwathi, UMuziwabantu, Umvoti, Umzimkhulu and Umzumbe. People are being urged to, if possible, stay indoors and off the roads and to avoid crossing rivers and swollen streams where water is above your ankles. If trapped in a vehicle during a flood, people are advised to abandon it and climb to higher ground. Take caution when traveling or avoid traveling as roads may be flooded.
