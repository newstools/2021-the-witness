A new mural at Gaming Corner in Edendale was inspired by popular video games Streetfighter, Grand Tourisma and Fifa. Business owners Zethule “Fluwid” Ndimande and Nhlakanipho Molefe commissioned street artist Jono Hornby to paint the building. Ndimande said the new PlayStation gaming arcade aimed to give children, living in the Ashdown area of Edendale, the chance to play the latest computer games — something which is out of the financial reach of most youngsters and their families. “By doing that we are keeping them out of trouble, out of being exposed to drugs at an early age,” he added. Before starting work on the mural, Hornby and Ndimande spoke about their own favourite games and visiting arcades when they were younger.

Creating the realities they wanted growing up. Isn’t that what it’s all about?” The games arcade business is already proving popular with children, who have been lining up to show off their skills. For Ndimande and Molefe, it’s just the start of more community-based programmes. They are also hoping to use Gaming Corner to connect children to the worlds of visual art, sport and music. “One of our future plans is to get five bicycles and to start hosting rides around the neighbourhood,” Ndimande said. Anyone who can assist Gaming Corner by donating bicycles is asked to contact 062 040 6562.
