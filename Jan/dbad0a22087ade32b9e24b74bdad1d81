Security guards at the social development Utrecht offices, in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, were tied up and locked in a room overnight during a robbery on Sunday night. The intruders stole 10 computers and two TV screens that were mounted in the reception and boardroom. They also took a state vehicle after finding the keys in one of the desk drawers. The security guards were rescued by the police on Monday morning. KwaZulu-Natal Social Development MEC, Nonhlanhla Khoza, said: “The robbery at our service office will result in a major setback to service our clients. The stolen computers contains sensitive information about people we serve daily.” She said the department had experienced a number of incidents in different offices across the province where vehicles and computers were stolen last year. In October The Witness reported that since 2017 the department had lost more than 50 cars to a syndicate that either stole them from offices or hijacked the social workers at gunpoint. “It is very disappointing that the criminals continue to target government offices. Any stolen government property has a major impact on service delivery to the communities,” said Khoza. She also expressed her concern that no one has been arrested even in the previous incidents. “There seems to be a syndicate of criminals operating across the province targeting offices of the Department of Social Development. Police have informed us that they are currently investigating the matter, with a view to having the perpetrators arrested.”
