A 12-year-old boy has died after he plunged 12 storeys at
a block of flats on Peter Mokaba Road in Morningside, Durban. ER24 said the child was found lying in the garden of the block of flats. He said another ambulance service was also on the scene. Russel Meiring of ER24 said, "Medics assessed the child and found that he had sustained numerous
injuries with his vital signs rapidly diminishing. "CPR and advanced life support interventions were immediately initiated
in an effort to revive the patient. Unfortunately, after some time, no vital
signs returned, and he was declared dead." Meiring said the details surrounding the incident are unknown, but local authorities
were on the scene for further investigations.
