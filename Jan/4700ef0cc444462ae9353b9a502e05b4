The husband of KwaZulu-Natal treasury MEC, Nomusa Dube-Ncube, died in hospital last night following a short illness. Sibusiso Ncube, who was also a prominent businessman, was rushed to hospital a few days ago. There have been rumours that Dube-Ncube was also gravely ill. However, sources close to the MEC said the rumours were not true. “She is fine. She even did Covid-19 tests and the results came back negative,” the source said. Brandpartners, the company where Ncube served as chairperson, said it was saddened by his passing. “It was a great privilege to know Mr Ncube personally and to work alongside him. His exceptional leadership style in his role as Chairman will be sorely missed at the company," the company’s chief executive, Clinton Govender said. "On behalf of our management team, staff and colleagues at Brandpartners, I would like to once again express our condolences to the Ncube family and pray that God grants them peace and comfort during this very emotional and stressful time,” said Govender.
