A 36-year-old truck driver is expected to appear at
Pietermaritzburgâ€™s Magistrate Court on Monday facing charges of reckless and
negligent driving and drunken driving after he allegedly lost control of his
truck on Friday evening on the corner of Alexandra and Camps Drift roads. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said two
passengers were injured in the crash and the truck driver was placed under
arrest. Eyewitnesses told The Witness that the driver of the truck,
which was carrying logs, failed to negotiate a turn and crashed the truck near
the Tubby Land preschool. Others said the truck driver reeked of alcohol when
he was pulled out of his truck by bystanders before the police and emergency
workers arrived at the scene. Gwala said Alexandra Road police are investigating charges
of reckless and negligent driving and drunken driving.
