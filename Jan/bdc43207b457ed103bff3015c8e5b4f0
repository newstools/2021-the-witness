A six-year-old boy, Thandokuhle Msane drowned on Wednesday afternoon while swimming with a group of his friends in the Mnamfu river lagoon in the Hibberdene area on the KZN South Coast. Despite the regulations about no swimming along beaches, Msane and his group of friends ventured into the water. Port Shepstone Search and Rescue, K9 SAPS and Medevac were called to the scene by members of the community. It is said that the boys were seen swimming in the lagoon from about 2 pm. “It was not long after that Msane had gotten into trouble and disappeared under the water, the group of friends had immediately contacted members of their community, who called the police,” said police officials on the scene. Warrant Office Romel Da Rose and his K9 dog, Bear, made their way into the water and Bear gave a positive indication as to where the body of the young boy was. Officers then searched the area and a few minutes after the indication by Bear, the body was recovered. Msane’s body had to be carried out to the roadway across dense bushy area, over a railway line and was handed over to the Hibberdene SAPS. An inquest will be investigated
