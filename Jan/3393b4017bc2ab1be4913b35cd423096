Showmax’s latest original series, The Real Housewives of Durban, attracted plenty of interest on social media ahead of its launch on Friday night. And, having watched the first episode, I reckon the hashtag #RHODurban will be trending at the top of South Africa’s Twitter rankings on Friday. The episode centres around Umhlanga resident, Sorisha Naidoo’s Diwali dinner. The former Miss India South Africa, actress and businesswoman, who is married to billionaire mogul, Vivian Reddy, decides to host the event to get to know the other “housewives”. She hires co-star, Kgomotso Ndungane’s events and floral business, Oak Celebrations; and Kgomotso, who is married to former Springbok Odwa, in turn, hires “housewife” Annie Ludick’s dance agency, LeopardPrint. Ludick, who is planning her white wedding to Durban businessman Kgolo Mthembu, also owns luxury beauty salon Annaesthetic and an events and marketing company. Everything seems to be perfectly aligned for a night of glamour, but things take an unexpected turn when Ayanda Ncwane, the chief executive officer of Ncwane Communications, president of the Africa Gospel Awards, and the widow of gospel legend Sfiso Ncwane, meets another guest. Who exactly is Nonku Williams, and why does she seem to know more about Ayanda, than she knows about her? If you missed the season opener, watch it on Showmax now. New episodes of The Real Housewives of Durban will air every Friday.
