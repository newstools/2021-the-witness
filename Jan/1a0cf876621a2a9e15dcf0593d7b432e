The office of KwaZulu-Natal treasury MEC, Nomusa Dube-Ncube, on Wednesday could not confirm rumours that she has been admitted to hospital. Dube-Ncube and her husband, Sibusiso Ncube, are rumoured to have fallen ill. While Dube-Ncube's spokesperson, Ndabenzihle Sibiya, declined to release details around her health, he tacitly confirmed that she was unwell. "At this stage, unfortunately, we are unable to respond to general enquiries from colleagues in the media. "We however wish to indicate that text messages and calls from the public are acknowledged with humility," he said. The department, Sibiya said, would issue a statement after consultations with "the executive authority".
