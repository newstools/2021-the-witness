Four men were arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit robbery and possession of illegal firearms and ammunition in the Pietermaritzburg CBD by members of the Pietermaritzburg K9 unit. KZN police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the four, between the ages of 31 and 39 years old, are due to appear before the Pietermaritzburg Magistrates Court on Monday. Mbele said they were arrested by members of the Pietermaritzburg K9 unit who were following up information about men who were planning to commit a robbery at a business premises in Boom Street in Pietermaritzburg. ”The team pounced on the suspects whilst they were at Boom Street. A search was conducted and two suspects were found in illegal possession of firearms and ammunition.” Mbele said the investigation conducted at the scene revealed that one of the firearms recovered was stolen during a burglary at a house in Imbali Township on September 7 last year. The KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula commended the team for the swift arrest of the suspects and for preventing a crime from being committed.
