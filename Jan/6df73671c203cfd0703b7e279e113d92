Former president Jacob Zuma on Friday suffered another blow after the Pietermaritzburg high court blocked French arms company Thales’s attempt to have the case it is facing along with him squashed. Thales wanted the court to set aside the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) decision to prosecute the company on racketeering charge.

The case brought by Thales, which is being represented by Oscar Pistorius’ former defence advocate Barry Roux, represented the only barrier standing in the way of Zuma’s long-awaited trial actually proceeding. Thales has yet to comment on the decision. Should it elect not to appeal, the Zuma and Thales corruption case could start as early as April this year. It is the state’s case that Thales agreed to pay Zuma a R500 000-a-year bribe, in exchange for his “political protection” from any potential investigation of South Africa’s multibillion-rand arms deal. Thales, then known as Thompson-CSF, had scored a R2,6-billion contract to provide four navy frigates to SA’s government in 1997, as part of that deeply controversial R60-billion deal. Our viewpoint | Let Zuma have his wish Zuma’s financial advisor Schabir Shaik’ s company, Nkobi, had been chosen by Thales as its black empowerment partner in Ssouth Africa after alleged lobbying by Zuma. Shaik was convicted in 2005 of having brokered that deal as part of his corrupt relationship with Zuma. The NPA is now pursuing Zuma and Thales for racketeering, a charge usually reserved for the prosecution of organised crime, and is pursued against individuals and entities embroiled in an organised criminal enterprise. It carries with it a 25-year jail sentence. In a brief statement yesterday morning, the NPA said it welcomed the court’s decision. “We look forward to the criminal hearing,” the statement ended.
