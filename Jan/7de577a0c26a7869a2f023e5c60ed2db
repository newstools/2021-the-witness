Maritzburg United on Thursday announced the signing of German goalkeeper Marcel Engelhardt following defensive problems at the club. Engelhardt, 27, has signed a two-and-a-half year deal and arrives from Eintracht Braunschweig, a club based in Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, which competes in Germany’s 2 Bundesliga division. Said the player: “I’m happy to be here, my new team-mates seem nice, the weather is quite hot as well - a big difference to Germany, I came here from snow,” he said. “I hope to bring quality on and off the field, to get to know the guys well so that we can compete together and achieve something.” The 27-year-old said it was an easy decision to switch continents after chatting with Maritzburg United head coach Ernst Middendorp. United will face Golden Arrows in the DStv Premiership in Durban on Saturday and will look to bounce back from two losses at home last week.
