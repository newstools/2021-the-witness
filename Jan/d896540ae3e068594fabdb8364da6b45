Police are searching for suspected livestock thieves after they managed to flee from police by throwing three stolen cows out of a moving taxi in the Karkloof area on Thursday. When they're caught, they'll also face charges of animal cruelty. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said on Thursday police officers from the Pietermaritzburg K9 Unit were conducting operations in Pietermaritzburg when they received information about a Toyota Quantum travelling in Karkloof with four stolen cattle. With the assistance of other law enforcement agencies, the car was pursued. During the chase, the suspects went on a gravel road towards New Hanover. “In an attempt to evade police, the suspects threw three cows out of the moving taxi. Their vehicle crashed near the farm hostels and the suspects fled the scene on foot.” Gwala said police impounded the taxi which had false registration plates for further investigation. She said investigations on the scene revealed that the livestock were stolen in the Rietvlei area. The police are still searching for the suspects. In another unrelated incident, Gwala said on Thursday at midday, the Himeville Stock Theft Unit assisted by Pietermaritzburg Stock Theft Unit recovered 35 suspected stolen goats in the Pata area at Pietermaritzburg. She said the goats were found at a house, but the owner of the house was not there. The animals were taken, and police are still searching for the owners.
