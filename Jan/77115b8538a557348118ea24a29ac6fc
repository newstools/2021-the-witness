Overland depression Eloise is currently situated along the border of Zimbabwe, Mozambique and South Africa and it is expected to move westwards, says the South African Weather Service (Saws). On Monday morning, the weather office said Eloise is advecting tropical moisture over the north-eastern parts of KwaZulu-Natal together with the surface ridging high bringing moisture from the south. “Tropical air will clash with cooler mid-latitudinal air causing some significant falls of rain flooding in north-eastern parts of King Cetshwayo and Zululand DM's.” The heavy rains are expected to lead to flooding of roads and settlements as well as damages to properties. Some communities may be temporarily inaccessible and may experience disruptions in municipal services, such as electricity and water. Major traffic disruptions, especially on Monday on major roads like N2. Saw urged the people to stay indoors and off the roads, avoid crossing rivers and swollen streams where water is above your ankles. If trapped in a vehicle during a flood, people are advised to abandon it and climb to higher ground. In buildings, move valuables to a safe place above the expected flood level.
