Is the Hilton Durban Hotel cancelling bookings in anticipation of closing their doors as of January 11? That's the question being asked after a social media message to this effect has been circulating. It is believed to be an email sent to some of their guests on Thursday afternoon. In the message, the hotel’s sales manager says bookings made until May 31, 2021, will be released from the hotel’s system and cancellation confirmations will be sent out individually per booking to the third party agencies. Hilton Durban is an iconic landmark hotel located near the Durban International Convention Centre. When The Witness called the hotel, two employees unofficially confirmed the closure, saying the hotel was not getting enough business to keep its doors open. The hotel’s online booking system would not accept bookings for after January 11, 2021. Some people took to the hotel’s Facebook page to ask why there were no rooms available and if the hotel was closing down. The hotel has not responded to questions sent to them by The Witness enquiring about the sudden closure. Their comment will be added to this article once they respond.
