The South African Post Office (Sapo) has called for calm as people are flocking their offices under the false belief that Friday, January 29, is the last day that they will be able to collect their Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grants. Sapo said as a result of the misinformation, beneficiaries are flocking to Post Office branches in large numbers. “Covid SRD relief money that has been approved will not expire and will remain available at the Post Office until it is collected. “There is no need to rush to the Post Office to collect your grant. The money will be waiting for you until you are able to collect it,” said the Post Office. Sapo said beneficiaries will receive an sms notification informing them of when to come and collect their grant at the Post Office branch.
