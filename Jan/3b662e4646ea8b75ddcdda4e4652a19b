Capital City Marathon organisers have taken the decision to postpone this year’s event until further notice. The second edition of the annual race, which consists of three distances, 42,2 km, 21,1 km, and 10 km, was scheduled to take place next month in Pietermaritzburg. Local runner Sanelisiwe Mbanjwa took top honours in the women’s marathon last year while Bongmusa Mthembu won the men’s 42,2 km race. The decision to cancel the event was taken after the organising committee met at the weekend. Chairperson of the committee Steve Mkasi said it was not possible for the race to go ahead under the current Covid-19 regulations, which limit gatherings to 50 people. “The 2021 Capital City Marathon has been postponed until further notice,” confirmed Mkasi yesterday. Mkasi said they were still hoping to host another race in the city later in the year and they will write to KwaZulu-Natal Athletics (KZNA) for permission. The Witness reported last week that Mkasi and his crew were hoping to replace the marathon with a two-day race event at a secluded area so that they could have a larger number of runners taking part without breaching the Covid-19 regulations. “The other plan [to have another race later this year] still continues, but obviously not on the date of the Capital City Marathon, so we are going to write to KwaZulu-Natal Athletics and ask them to give us a date later in the year,” he said.
