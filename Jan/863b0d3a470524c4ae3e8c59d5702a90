The famous Midmar Mile has been postponed by a month following the spike in Covid-19 cases, the organisers said on Friday. The open water swim event was scheduled to take place on Valentine’s Day weekend at Midmar Dam outside Pietermaritzburg. However, the event will now be hosted at the dam on March 13 and 14.

We are also respectful of the pressure that hospitals and medical staff are under at this time. “Time on duty plus the possibility of a medical emergency at the event would only place further demands on medical staff which we would all agree is not necessary,” he said. Riddin also that the current regulations do not allow for swimmers to train in open water, and many are struggling to find a pool while dams, rivers and beaches remain closed to swimming. He said the postponement to March will give entrants extra time to prepare for what will be the 48th Midmar Mile. Together with input from representatives from KZN Wildlife and the safety committee, the race committee is investigating the feasibility of holding the events over more than two days.

The organisers said depending on President Cyril Ramaphosa’s next announcement and the level of lockdown, some further changes may still need to be made, including the possibility of holding the event even later on in the year.
