Members from Durban SAPS Search and Rescue along with eThekwini Fire and Rescue were called out to Monteseel on Tuesday after Nhlalenhle security guards caught four people stealing batteries from a Vodacom tower near the Lookout point in Durban. Police said the four people were travelling in a white Chevrolet LDV and when the police approached them, a vehicle chase ensued as the suspected thieves tried to flee, causing the driver of the car to lose control. The car rolled over and two of the suspects were arrested at the scene, while the another two ran down an embankment into dense bushes. Police said the third suspect was later arrested by the security officers. One Vodacom cellphone tower battery was recovered from the vehicle. The mountainous area was searched by SAPS Search and Rescue Team members with no sign of the fourth suspect. The arrested suspects were detained by members from Inchanga police. The matter is being investigated by the police.
