The national government wants doctors and nurses working in
clinics to be removed from the list of healthcare workers who will be the first
in line to receive Covid-19 vaccines. This was revealed by KwaZulu-Natal health MEC, Nomagugu
Simelane-Zulu. Briefing members of the KZN legislature health portfolio
committee, Simelane-Zulu said the national government has proposed to
provincial governments that the health workers should be removed from the list. "We (the KZN provincial government) did not accept the
proposal. "We don't think that will assist us. When our people
get sick the first place they go is our primary healthcare centres," she
said. The national government would be receiving a batch of one
million Covid-19 doses from India at the end of the week. The one million doses, which would be followed by a second
batch of 500 000 doses, are meant for the country's 1.2 million healthcare
workers.
