KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala welcomed President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision to declare a provincial official funeral for Transport and Community Safety MEC Bheki Ntuli. Ntuli, who will be buried this week, was accorded a category one provincial official funeral alongside former uKhozi FM station manager Welcome “Bhodloza” Nzimande, who died last week following a short illness. Ramaphosa’s decision follows a request by the provincial government that Ntuli and Nzimande be accorded special funerals. Zikalala said the two deserved to be honoured for the contributions they made in building peace and developing the people of the province. “We are humbled by this gesture by the president to honour these distinguished citizens of our province with such a fitting farewell. “Anyone chronicling the history of KwaZulu-Natal and South Africa would be found wanting if the names of MEC Bheki “Mphemba” Ntuli and Welcome “Bhodloza” Nzimande did not take pride of place,” he said. Nzimade will be buried at is birth place of ePhatheni in Richmond today, while Ntuli will be buried at his hometown of Empangeni tomorrow. “Flags will accordingly fly at half-mast as directed by the president, in line with the policy governing Provincial Official Funeral category one,” Zikalala said.
