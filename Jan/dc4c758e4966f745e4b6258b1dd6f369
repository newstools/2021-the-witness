A day out at Midmar Dam has ended in tragedy for a family when a 12-year-old boy drowned on Wednesday. And in a twist, a second body of a person unrelated to the boy's drowning, was discovered when the paramedics from the Midlands EMS responded to the call for help. According to a statement released by the Howick-based emergency medical response company, when their team reached Midmar they found child was lying motionless on the side of the dam. The boy's father was at the scene. Apparently the 12-year-old had been swimming when he got into trouble and was pulled from the water. "After a lengthy attempt to resuscitate the youngster he was sadly declared deceased." It was then that the paramedics made the gruesome discovery of a lifeless man a mere 500 metres from where the 12-year-old had drowned. He was floating face down in the water.Â This man was removed from the water by SAPS Search and Rescue Unit. It was later established that he went missing from Pietermaritzburg on the January 10 and a missing persons report had been opened by the police. His family was notified. This is a developing story.
