In the past MKMVA members orgnaised protests in eThekwini that saw foreign national shops being attacked and roads being blocked. Acting Transport and Community Safety MEC, Kwazi Mshengu said police were ready to crash the protest. “We are visiting all the truck shops around Durban to ensure all systems are in place following intelligence reports which indicate that there may be possible disruptions in our highways and major routes in the province. “We can confirm that all our law enforcement agencies are on high alert and there will be no one that will be spared if they transgress the law,” he said.
