The KwaDukuza SAPS has warned residents to be aware of a conman pretending to be a KwaDukuza SAPS officer who demands money from victims on the pretext that they will face a fine for contravening Covid-19 regulations.. The conman uses WhatsApp to text unsuspecting residents claiming they have contravened the Covid-19 Disaster Management Act. According to KwaDukuza SAPS communication official Priya Nunkumar the fake profile (pictured) on WhatsApp, sends messages to members of the community identifying himself as Captain Selvin Gounden with a fake Persal number. “The person is not employed by KwaDukuza SAPS. He is messaging victims using the following number 064 984 7807. “He is demanding money from residents saying that it is a fine they need to pay for going out without masks, going out during curfew, etc.” She said KwaDukuza SAPS will never use WhatsApp to contact any member of the public regarding an arrest or fine. “Nor will we request members of the public to pay money to avoid an arrest.” She advised that residents who are messaged by the conman should block the number immediately. To report any incidents contact KwaDukuza SAPS on 032 551 8206.
