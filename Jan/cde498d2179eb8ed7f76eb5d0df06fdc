Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife’s Giant’s Castle Resort has closed
after two staff members tested positive for Covid-19. Ezemvelo said in a statement that five other employees with
Covid-19 symptoms are awaiting the results of Covid-19 tests. “The two Covid-19 positive employees have been in repeated
direct contact with all 24 employees working at the Giant's Castle Resort,”
said spokesperson Musa Mntambo. “This thus necessitated that the whole staff compliment of
Giant's Castle goes on self-isolation with immediate effect.  The Resort has now been closed until Friday, January
15.” The Giant's Castle resort becomes the second Ezemvelo resort
to close due to Covid-19 related reasons. The first resort which was closed
last week was the Hilltop resort situated inside Hluhluwe iMfolozi Park Mntambo said Ezemvelo's Central Reservations have begun a
process of contacting all guests booked during the affected dates. The affected
guests are provided with the following options:  “Ezemvelo's Wellness team will also be informing all guests
who might have had some form of direct contact with the affected employees
during their stay at the Resort.” Mntambo said that Ezemvelo has been forced to take “drastic action”
in reviewing its housekeeping protocols for all of its resorts. The review has necessitated the temporary introduction of
new housekeeping protocols to try and reduce the possibility of either the guests
or employees contacting Covid-19 within resorts. For further information regarding your booking, please
