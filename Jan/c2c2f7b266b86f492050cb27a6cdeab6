A man was shot twice during an alleged house break-in in Tongaat early Tuesday morning. According to Reaction Unit SA’s (Rusa) spokesperson, Prem Balram, a resident contacted them just after 3am reporting a person running through their property. Balram said that Rusa officers were sent to the address where they found a man bleeding badly on the pavement, with wounds to his leg and pelvis. “It was established that the suspect and an accomplice were in the process of breaking into a garage when he was confronted by the homeowner who was armed with a shotgun,” said Balram. Balram said it is alleged that one of the men tried to attack the homeowner, who retaliated by firing two rounds. The men fled over the boundary wall into the neighbouring properties, but the injured man collapsed while trying to make his getaway. Two spent shotgun casings were recovered on the property. The second assailant managed to evade arrest. Police were called to the scene and are investigating further.
