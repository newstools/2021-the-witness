A 74-year-old woman was left tied up in her home early on Saturday morning by three men who stole household items and her car in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal. The vehicle was later found abandoned in the Bishopstowe area. Police spokesperson, Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese, said that the woman was outside her house in Ashburton, talking to the security guard next door when she was approached by three men. “One had a firearm and another a knife,” he said. The men instructed her to go back inside the house. They then tied her up using duct tape, added Ngobese. The security guard came to her assistance but was overpowered and also tied up. He said that the woman and guard were not injured. Ngobese said that police are investigating a case of house robbery. The suspects have not yet been arrested. It is believed that another elderly man was tied up and robbed in Ashburton during the week. His car was also later found abandoned.
