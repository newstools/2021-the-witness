This year’s Royal Show in Pietermaritzburg has been cancelled in its entirety due to Covid-19. This was confirmed on Thursday by CEO of the Royal Agricultural Society, Terry Strachan. “For the second consecutive year and owing to persistent uncertainty as to the progression of Covid-19 it remains improbable that any South African event catering for large groups will be permitted prior to October 2021,” said Strachan in a media statement. “The Royal Agricultural Society acknowledges with appreciation persons and organisations who have already devoted time and resources in preparing for this year’s event which regrettably is not to be,” said Strachan.
