An induna died in a hail of gunfire in the Mpophomeni area, under the Umgungundlovu District on Friday night. Richard Bonginkosi Dlomo (44) was shot 12 times and died at the scene of the ambush-style attack at his home. Dlomo who has been induna for only two years under ward 8 and 9, had just came back from fetching his wife Zinhle Ngcobo from work when he was attacked. He had parked his car and went to check on his son’s room which is in an outside building when he came under attack and was shot. His wife Zinhle told The Witness that she just heard gunshots going off soon after she entered the house. “He was shot 12 times and died on the spot. He parked the car. I jumped out and went inside the house. He then went behind the main house to check our son’s room and on his way back he was shot. “We believe that the people who shot him entered our home on foot as there was no car waiting on the road,” she said. Police were not available for comment. This brings to over 23 the number of KZN izinduna gunned down since January 2019.
