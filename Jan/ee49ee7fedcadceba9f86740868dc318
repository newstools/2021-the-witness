The SA Weather Service (Saws) warned on Thursday that widespread showers and thundershowers are expected over most of KZN for the day. The weather office said rainfall accumulations of more than 40mm already fallen in some places over KZN. "Rain is expected to continue this morning which might result in localised flooding in some parts of the province."  Saws said they expect localised flooding of susceptible informal settlements or roads, low-lying areas and major roads affected. "Difficult driving conditions due to slippery roads and reduced visibility may result in minor motor vehicle accidents in major roads like the N2 and N3, Possible mudslides and rockfalls along roads. * If you have a rain gauge, tell us how much rain you've collected in the last 24 hours in the comments section."If possible stay indoors and off the roads, avoid crossing rivers and swollen streams where water is above your ankles. If trapped in a vehicle during a flood, abandon it and climb to higher ground. In buildings, move valuables to a safe place above the expected flood level. Switch off electricity at the supply point to the building. In rural areas protect/relocate animals to a safe place on higher ground."
