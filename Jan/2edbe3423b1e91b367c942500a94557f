KwaZulu-Natal Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza has called on police to track down a jilted ex-boyfriend who stabbed a woman 14 times before leaving her for dead. The MEC said the pair had known each other for some time and have a child together but had recently split up. It's alleged that the ex-boyfriend entered the woman's house in Willowfountain, KwaTomu area while she was sleeping over the Christmas weekend and demanded that they rekindle the relationship. “After she refused, the man threatened to kill her and the children, and pull her out of the bed. The heartless man stabbed the 36-year-old woman and left her for dead. The victim was rushed to hospital after she crawled to the neighbour’s house,” she said. Reacting to this horrific incident, MEC Khoza said the woman was lucky to survive. "We are extremely concerned that this man is still at large, and we fear that he might come back to finish her off. The woman had ended their relationship and the attempt to get her back failed. This man decided to abuse and stab the defenceless woman who had lost interest in him," said Khoza. She described the man's action as cowardly. "We want to see this man being caught and spend a long time in prison for abusing the woman. As the province, we have been dealing with a lot of incidents of gender-based violence and we want to see all those involved being arrested and successfully prosecuted," she added. MEC Khoza said social workers would also explore the option of removing the woman from her home to a safe place. She also called on members of the public to work with the police to ensure that the perpetrator gets arrested. "We need communities to work closely with law enforcement agencies, government and all other sectors to end the scourge of gender-based violence," she said. The Department has dispatched a team of social workers to provide psycho-social support to the woman and her children.
