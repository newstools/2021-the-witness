Entertainment brand Musica is shutting shop in South Africa, retail group Clicks announced on Thursday. The board took the decision to close Musica with effect from 31 May 2021. The brand has already closed 19 stores since the start of the financial year and 59 outlets are currently still operating. The these stores will be closed as leases expire. Clicks bought Musica in 1992 and that it has been operating in a declining market for several years owning to the structural shift globally to the digital consumption of music, movies and games. "The inevitable demise of the brand ahs been accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic which resulted in the rapid decline in foot traffic in destination malls where Musica stalls are typically situated," the group said in the statement. Where possible, Musica staff had been absorbed in the group's expanding health and beauty store network.
